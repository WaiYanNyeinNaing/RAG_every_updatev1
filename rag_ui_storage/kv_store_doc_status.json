Carefully plan where you install the heater. Correct combustion air supply and vent pipe installation are very important. If not installed correctly, fatal accidents can occur, such as carbon monoxide poisoning or fire. \n\nWhen the unit is installed indoors with DIRECT VENT (exhaust vent and air intake connected to the outside) it is permitted to be located in bathrooms, bedrooms and occupied rooms that are normally kept closed. See chapter 4.6 (page 18). If the unit will be installed indoors and use indoor combustion air (NON-DIRECT VENT), the place where you install the heater must have enough ventilation. The National Fuel Gas Codes do not allow NON-DIRECT VENT gas fired water heater installations in bathrooms, bedrooms or any occupied rooms normally kept closed. See chapter 4.6 (page 18). \n\n4. You must correctly vent your heater. See chapter 4.6 (page 18) on VENTING. 5. The appliance and its gas connection must be leak tested before placing the appliance in operation. The appliance must be isolated from the gas supply piping system by \n\nclosing its individual manual gas shutoff valve (not supplied with heater) during any pressure testing at pressures in excess of $\\%$ Psig (3.5 kPa). \n\n6. Keep the water heater area clear and free from combustibles and flammable liquids. Do not locate the heater over any material which might burn. \n\n7. Correct gas pressure is critical for the proper operation of this heater. Gas piping must be sized to provide the required pressure at the maximum output of the heater, while all the other gas appliances are in operation. Check with your local gas supplier, and see the section on connecting the gas supply. See chapter 4.8 (page 33). \n\n8. Should overheating occur or the gas supply fail to shut off, turn off the gas supply at the manual gas shut off valve, on the gas line. Note: manual gas shutoff valve is not supplied with the heater but must be field installed. \n\n9. Do not use this appliance if any part has been underwater. Immediately call the responsible party for the installation of your appliance to inspect the appliance and to replace any part of the water heater which has been underwater. \n\n10.Failure to install the heater correctly may lead to unsafe operation. \n\n▶ Improper operation.   \n▶ Loss of warranty. \n\nDANGER: \n\n▶ The water heater must be installed by a Locally Licensed Professional in accordance with these instructions. If improperly installed, a hazardous condition such as explosion or carbon monoxide poisoning could result.

The minimum combustion air pipe length is one 1 ft pipe or one $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ elbow with an air intake grill cap to prevent debris from falling into the appliance. \n\nMaximum combustion air and exhaust pipe length \n\nThe table 8 displays the maximum allowable straight pipe lengths for air intake and exhaust piping. Reduce the maximum allowable pipe length by the equivalent lengths for each elbow used and termination used. \n\nPROPER GAS PRESSURE! \n\nThe following section assumes the water heater will receive gas pressure greater than or equal to 5\" WC for the 199kBTU models $4 \"$ WC for 160kBTU models). In cases of gas pressure below 5\" WC for the 199kBTU (4\" WC for the 160kBTU models) the maximum heat input is reduced. \n\n1) Do not exceed the maximum length allowance for either pipe by combining them.   \n2) To assure maximum heat input at maximum vent length minimum gas pressure should be 5\" W.C. for the 199 kBTU models and $4 \" W . C$ for the 160 kBTU models. \n\nTable 8 Maximum Allowable Exhaust and Air intake Lengths \n\nDo not extend exposed vent pipe outside the building beyond recommended distance. Condensate could freeze and block vent pipe. Vent should terminate at least 3 feet $( 9 1 5 \\mathsf { m m } )$ ) away from adjacent walls, inside corners and 5 feet $1 5 2 5 \\mathsf { m m }$ below roof overhang. \n\nImproper gas pressure or vent length may result in undesired symptoms or errors such as noisy burner, C1, C2, CF, EA, EC. \n\nThe vent for this appliance shall not terminate: \n\n1. over public walkways; or   \n2. near soffit vents or crawl space vents or other areas where condensate or vapor could create a nuisance or hazard or cause papery damage; or   \n3. where condensate vapor could cause damage or could be detrimental to the operation of regulators, relief valves, or other equipment. \n\nThe values of maximum flue length in table 8 are before any deductions for elbows or terminations. \n\nRequired direct vent terminal clearances (twin pipe / concentric penetration) \n\n1) In accordance with the current CSA B149.1 Natural Gas and Propane Installation Code.   \n2) In accordance with the current ANSI Z223.1 / NFPA 54, National Fuel Gas Code.   \n3) A vent shall not terminate directly above a sidewalk or paved driveway that is located between two single family dwellings and serves both dwellings.   \n4) Permitted only if veranda, porch, deck or balcony is fully open on a minimum of two sides beneath the floor.   \n5) If locally adopted installation codes specify clearances different than those illustrated, then the most stringent clearance shall prevail. \n\nTable 9 \n\n[\\*] Clearance in accordance with local installation codes and the requirements of the gas supplier. \n\nRequired other than direct vent terminal clearances (single pipe penetration) \n\n1) In accordance with the current CSA B149.1 Natural Gas and Propane Installation Code.   \n2) In accordance with the current ANSI Z223.1 / NFPA 54 National Fuel Gas Code.   \n3) A vent shall not terminate directly above a sidewalk or paved driveway that is located between two single family dwellings and serves both dwellings.   \n4) Permitted only if veranda, porch, deck or balcony is fully open on a minimum of two sides beneath the floor.   \n5) If locally adopted installation codes specify clearances different than those illustrated, then the most stringent clearance shall prevail. \n\n[\\*] - Clearance in accordance with local installation codes and the requirements of the gas supplier. \n\n4.6.4 Recommended Vent Configuration Examples \n\nBelow are approved examples of vertical and horizontal venting installations. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nUsing a single pipe vent in cold climates puts the water heater at risk of freezing, as negative air pressure is common in buildings during cold weather. This situation will pull cold air through the heat exchanger and can lead to damage and a water leak and is not covered by the product's warranty. In the event of negative air pressure causing back drafting contact a Locally Licensed Professional for remedial advice. \n\n[1] Exhaust   \n[2] Air intake   \n[3] Concentric Vent kit   \n[4] Exhaust pipe   \n[5] Air Intake pipe   \n[LA] Minimum 1\"   \n[1] Exhaust   \n[2] Intake   \n[A] 12 inches $( 3 0 5 \\mathsf { m m } )$ ) (18 in. for Canada) above maximum snow level or at least 24 inches $\\left( 6 1 0 \\mathsf { m m } \\right)$ , whichever is greater.   \n[B] 12 inches (305 mm)   \n[C] 12 inches $( 3 0 5 \\mathsf { m m } )$ minimum above air intake opening   \n[1] Termination   \n[2] Water heater   \n[3] Elbow   \n[4] Horizontal run should slope ¼\" per foot upwards to water heater   \n[LA] 12 inches $( 3 0 5 \\mathsf { m m } )$ ) (18 in. for Canada) above maximum snow level or at least 24 inches $( 6 1 0 \\mathsf { m m } )$ ), whichever is greater \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ The venting system must be installed in accordance with the vent system manufacturer’s instructions.   \n▶ In case vent system manufacturer instructions are not provided, it is recommended to place pipe supports every 5 feet on horizontal runs, beginning with support near water heater.   \nPeriodic cleaning of the vent terminal and air intake screens is mandatory.   \nAvoid locating vent terminals near equipment, vegetation, plants or building features which can be subject to degradation from exhaust gases. \n\n[1] Intake [2] Exhaust \n\n[1] Intake   \n[2] Exhaust   \n[X] At least 1foot (305mm) \n\n[1] Intake [2] Exhaust [3] Termination [1] Intake [2] Exhaust \n\nWith Flex Pipe the maximum length is reduced by $6 0 \\%$ , (applies only to the section in flex PP).

This drains condensation formed in the secondary heat exchanger. Piping must be installed under the condensate drain outlet on the water heater and piped for disposal in accordance with local codes. \n\nTo install the condensate drain, connect a ¾\"NPT adapter on the water heater. Use only Teflon tape. Do not block vacuum relief opening. \n\n[1] Condensate drain connection [2] Breather \n\nInstalling an additional breather downstream in not necessary since this function is already included in the heater. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nA blocked breather may cause an undesired double-siphon effect. \n\n▶ Ensure that the vacuum relief opening included in the siphon is not obstructed (for example with pipe dope) to allow correct function. \n\nVerify condensate disposal/neutralization is in accordance with federal, State, and local regulation. \n\nThis is a high efficiency appliance, condensate flow can be as much as $2 . 1 \\ : \\mathrm { g a l / h r }$ at full power. \n\n4.6.6 Backdraft reducer \n\nThe backdraft reducer (9301BFP) is the preferred option for limiting backdraft (see fig. 21). \n\nThe backdraft reducer (9301BFP) is sized for 3\" diameter PVC. \n\nIt is possible to use Backdraft reducer (9301BFP) for 2\" installations.   \nThis requires $2 \"$ to $3 \"$ adapters. \n\nInstallation \n\nFor the backdraft reducer to be effective, the internal flapper must be $100 \\%$ closed when the water heater is not running. Refer to fig. 23 for preferred installation positions in the vent system. \n\nInstallation requirements: \n\n▶ Install the damper per the supplied manufacturer‘s instructions. The damper is only to be used in the exhaust vent piping.   \n▶ Ensure directional arrow on damper label faces in the same direction as exhaust flow.   \n▶ If installed horizontally, the axis must be horizontal or slightly pitched up towards termination to ensure damper closes $100 \\%$ when heater is not running.   \n▶ To allow accessibility, the damper must not be installed in an enclosed section of vent pipe.   \nDo not install the damper in unconditioned spaces (e.g. attics) Condensation can build up while the heater is running which can later freeze and potentially block the flapper. \n\n[1] Good [2] Better [3] Best \n\n4.6.7 Single Pipe Venting \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ Single pipe venting not recommended in cold climates. Installations resulting in negative pressure/back draft require sealed combustion (twin pipe / concentric).Damage caused from back draft, ie. freezing, are not covered by warranty. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ When installed in an environment where corrosive chemicals or dirty air (e.g. hair salons, car washes) are present the sealed combustion (twin pipe or concentric) is required. \n\nAir combustion \n\nDANGER: \n\nThe lack of adequate air openings may lead to improper operation due to other appliances consuming required air. \n\n▶ Always follow local codes and regulations of authority having jurisdiction in case of single pipe installation in confined spaces. \n\nAlthough it is permissible to draw the air-intake from the inside, it is not the manufacturer’s recommended installation method. Install a $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ elbow or air intake screen on the top of the airintake inlet adaptor to prevent foreign objects from falling into the unit. \n\nIf a single pipe installation is utilized, follow guidelines below for providing adequate combustion air for the water heater as well as any other appliances that may consume air in the same space. Always follow local codes and regulations of the authority having jurisdiction. \n\n• Appliances located in unconfined spaces: \n\n– a) An unconfined space is one whose volume is greater than 50 cubic feet (1.42 cubic meter) per 1000 BTU/ hr (292.81 Watts) of the combined rating of all appliances installed in the space. That would be 9950 cubic feet (281.8 cubic meters) or 1243 square feet with 8 foot ceiling, for a single 199 kBTU water heater. b) In unconfined spaces in buildings of conventional frame, masonry, or metal construction, infiltration air is normally adequate to provide air for combustion. \n\n• Appliances located in confined spaces: \n\nThe confined space must be provided with two permanent openings, one commencing within 12 inches $( 3 0 4 . 8 \\mathsf { m m } )$ of the top and one commencing within 12 inches $( 3 0 4 . 8 \\mathsf { m m } )$ of the bottom of the enclosure. Each opening must have a minimum free area of one square inch per: \n\n– 1000 BTU/hr (292.81 Watts) if all air is taken from inside the building 2000 BTU/hr (585.62 Watts) if all air is taken from the outside by horizontal ducts 4000 BTU/hr (1171.24 Watts) if all air is taken from the outside by direct openings or vertical ducts \n\nOr the confined space must be provided with one permanent opening or duct that is within 12 inches $( 3 0 4 . 8 \\mathsf { m m } )$ of the ceiling of the enclosure. This opening must have a minimum free area of one square inch per: \n\n– 3000 BTU/hr (878.43 Watts) if all air is taken from the outside by a direct opening or vertical duct. \n\nLouvers, grills and screens have a blocking effect, when used, increase the sizes of your openings by $300 \\%$ for wood louvers (as wood type will reduce the free air by $7 5 \\%$ ) and $4 3 \\%$ for metal louvers (as metal will reduce the free air by $3 0 \\%$ ). Refer to the National Fuel Gas Code for complete information. \n\n4.7 Factory settings \n\nThe appliances are supplied having been set in the factory for the values shown on the rating plate for natural gas. For any other adjustments see chapter 8.12. \n\n4.7.1 Natural gas \n\nThe appliances must not be operated if the dynamic gas pressure is less than $3 . 5 ^ { \\stackrel {  } { \\mathrm { W C } ^ { 1 } } ) }$ or greater than 10.5” WC. \n\n4.7.2 Liquid propane gas (after gas conversion) \n\nThe appliances must not be operated if the dynamic gas pressure is less than 8”WC or greater than 13” WC. \n\nIf gas conversion is needed (Natural Gas to Liquid propane gas), see section 6.8. \n\nWARNING: \n\n▶ The gas type conversion must only be carried out by a Locally Licensed Professional, see chapter 6.8.1 Gas conversion. \n\n4.8 Gas piping & connections \n\nBefore connecting the gas supply, be sure that the heater is set for the same gas to which it will be connected. In the United States: The installation must conform with local codes or, in the absence of local codes, the National Fuel Gas Code ANSI Z223.1/NFPA 54. In Canada: The Installation must conform to CGA B149 INSTALLATION CODES and/or local installation codes. \n\nDANGER: \n\nExplosion hazard! \n\n▶ DO NOT connect to an unregulated or high pressure propane line or to a high pressure commercial natural gas line. \n\nDANGER: \n\nExplosion hazard! \n\n▶ The heater must be isolated from the gas supply piping system during any pressure testing of that system at test pressures equal to or more than 0.5 psig. If overpressure has occurred, such as through improper testing of the gas lines or malfunction of the supply system, the gas valve must be checked for safe operation. \n\nGAS CONNECTIONS \n\n▶ Install a manual gas shut off valve on the gas supply line within easy reach of the appliance.   \n▶ Install a union when connecting the gas supply.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Gas connection to the water heater is ¾\" NPT. See chapter 4.8.1 for the minimum internal pipe diameter required.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Undersized flexible appliance connector is not permitted.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ National Fuel Gas Code requires that a sediment trap (drip leg) be installed on gas appliances not so equipped. The drip leg must be accessible and not subject to freezing conditions. Install in accordance with the recommendations of the serving gas supplier, see fig. 25.   \n▶ Tighten gas pipe with the support of a wrench, see fig. 24.   \n[1] Shut off valve   \n[2] Gas supply   \n[3] Cap   \n[LA] Minimum 3\" sediment trap, (drip leg) \n\nOnce connections are made, check for gas leaks at all joints. Apply some gas leak detection solution to all gas fittings. Bubbles are a sign of a leak. A combustible gas detector may also be used to detect for leaks. \n\nDANGER: \n\nExplosion hazard! \n\n▶ If you detect a gas leak, shut off the gas and ventilate the room (open windows, doors). Tighten appropriate fittings to stop leak. Turn the gas on and check again with a gas leak detection solution. Never test for gas leaks using a match or flame. \n\nGAS LINE SIZING \n\nThe gas supply piping for a single heater should be sized for a maximum draw of 199000 BTU/hr for Greentherm T9900 SE/i. Measure the length of the gas supply line from the building's gas main to the heater and use the chapter 4.8.1 and 4.8.2 or the gas line manufacturer’s sizing tables to determine the pipe diameter necessary. If there are more gas appliances on the line, size the gas line according to the total maximum amount of BTU draw input rating of all appliances combined. \n\nNote: Undersizing the gas line may result in diminished hot water flow rate and temperature, or improper appliance operation (noise and combustion instabilities). See chapter 4.13, page 44 for the procedure to measure gas pressure. Proper gas pressure must be confirmed at time of installation. \n\n4.8.1 Gas Line Sizing Tables for NATURAL GAS \n\nFor your convenience, see below an excerpt from gas line sizing tables for a single NG appliance. For details, see the current NFPA 54. \n\nRequired input for 160000 / 199000 BTU/hr for the Greentherm T9900 SE/i. The gas supply system must be sized for the combined total maximum BTU/hr load requirements of all gas appliances running simultaneously. \n\nThe tables below show the maximum capacity of the gas supply pipe in cubic feet per hour. Please contact your local gas supplier for the energy content of the gas to determine the BTU/hr capacity. Use 1,000 BTU/cubic foot for rough estimations. \n\n\\* EHD $=$ Equivalent Hydraulic Diameter. The greater the value of EHD, the greater the gas capacity of the tubing. \n\n4.8.2 Gas Line Sizing Tables for LP GAS \n\nFor your convenience, see below an excerpt from gas line sizing tables for a single LP appliance. Their intended use is for pipe sizing between the 2nd stage (low pressure) regulator and the appliance. For details, see the current NFPA 54 or NFPA 58. \n\nRequired input for 160000 / 199000 BTU/hr for the Greentherm T9900 SE/i. The gas supply system must be sized for the combined total maximum BTU/hr load requirements of all gas appliances running simultaneously. \n\n$\\star _ { \\sf E H D } =$ Equivalent Hydraulic Diameter. The greater the value of EHD, the greater the gas capacity of the tubing. \n\n\\* Source National Fuel Gas Code NFPA 54, ANSI Z223.1 - No Additional Allowance is necessary for an ordinary number of fittings. \n\n4.9 Water quality \n\nWater quality can have an impact on appliance longevity. Water supplied to the Greentherm T9900 SE/i must be in accordance with table 17 and fig. 26. \n\nFor water analysis data call your local water department, or if on a well, have well water analyzed periodically. Heavy scale will form if the combination of water total hardness and pH exceeds the values specified in fig. 26 (grey area), Bosch recommends consulting a local water treatment professional for water softening/conditioning options. \n\n1. Total Harness and pH maximum values must be evaluated in combination. Indicated maximum values will be reduced according to fig. 26.   \n2. Combined values of total hardness and pH must be under the indicated grey area. (e.g. the pair [180;8.3] [total hardness; pH] is not acceptable). \n\nConnecting the pressure relief valve (PRV) \n\nA pressure relief valve is included in the box and must be installed at the time of installation. No valve is to be placed between the PRV and the heater. No reducing coupling or other restriction may be installed in the discharge line. The discharge line must be a minimum of 4” above a drain and installed such that it allows complete drainage of both the PRV and the line. The discharge line must be placed where it will not cause any damage. \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ Use the integrated port to install the PRV, see Fig. 27 [1].   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Tighten the PRV with the support of a wrench, see Fig. 27.   \n▶ Support all piping. \n\n4.10 Water connections \n\nWater connections are on top ONLY.   \nBottom connections are drain/service ports with limited flow capacity. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nThis heater is not approved for preheated water applications exceeding $1 4 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { F }$ $( 6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } )$ for Residential appliances, in these cases use a 3-way valve or mixing valve must be installed before the appliance to prevent water exceeding $1 4 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { F }$ $( 6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } )$ for Residential appliances from entering the appliance. \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ When facing the heater, the ¾\" cold connection is on the top right and the hot connection is on the top left.   \nTighten all water connections with the support of a wrench, see Fig. 28. \n\n[1] Cold connection [2] Hot connection [1] Cap [2] Water filter \n\nNOTICE: \n\nAppliance damage! \n\nAppliance will overheat if not filled with water. \n\n▶ Ensure that the appliance is filled with water by opening a hot water faucet, before plug in the water heater to the power supply. \n\n▶ The use of unions when connecting to the inlet and outlet connections is recommended. This will facilitate any necessary servicing.   \n▶ Plastic or PEX type plumbing materials are not suitable for connecting directly to or within $1 8 \"$ of the water heater.   \n▶ Although water piping throughout the building may not be copper, we require that copper or suitably rated stainless steel flex line be used for the water connections for $1 8 \"$ on either side of the water heater (follow local codes if more stringent).   \n▶ Never sweat any piping directly to water connections, as damage will occur.   \n▶ Keep water inlet and outlet pipes to no less than ¾\" diameter to allow the full flow capacity.   \nIf the cold and hot connections to the heater are reversed, the heater will not function.   \n▶ Be certain there are no loose particles or dirt in the piping. Blow out or flush the lines before connecting to the water heater.   \n▶ Full port shutoff valves should be installed on both the cold water supply and hot water outlet lines to facilitate servicing the heater (see fig. 27).   \nFor installation on a private well system with a pressure tank, the lowest pressure range setting recommended is 30-45 psi (2.06 - 3.1bar) to ensure optimal performance. \n\n4.11 Domestic hot water recirculation \n\nThe following drawings are provided to illustrate two possible recirculation designs. These schematic is for illustration only and must not be used for actual Installation without appropriate engineering and technical advice from a properly licensed professional in the locality where the installation is made. \n\nIn order to reduce the heat loss through the pipes, it’s recommended to insulate all the pipes in the recirculation circuit. \n\n4.11.1 Start up procedure \n\nAppliance damage! \n\n▶ Ensure that the water circuit is fill before activate recirculation mode. \n\n▶ Open a hot water faucet to fill the water circuit.   \n▶ Open the purge valve in the recirculation circuit (dedicated mode) near the appliance water inlet.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Turn on the appliance.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Set the recirculation mode in HMI. Wait until there is no air in the recirculation circuit (a few minutes).   \nClose water faucets. The recirculation system is operational. \n\n4.11.2 Recirculation options \n\nHouse Recirculation \n\nCompatible with dedicated return line and cross over mode with thermal by-pass valve. \n\n• Dedicated mode \n\nA dedicated return line is required in the installation. \n\n[1] Cold inlet supply   \n[2] Check valve field supplied   \n[3] Expansion tank field supplied   \n[4] Purge Valve recirculation circuit   \n[5] Shutoff valves field supplied   \n[6] Cold water inlet   \n[7] Gas supply   \n[8] Shutoff gas valve   \n[9] Hot water outlet   \n[10] Pressure relief valve \n\n• Cross Over Mode \n\nCross over mode requires two (2) Grundfos thermal by-pass valves or one (1) AquaMotion AMK-ODR valve. \n\n[1] Cold inlet supply   \n[2] Check valve field supplied   \n[3] Expansion tank field supplied   \n[4] Shutoff valves field supplied   \n[5] Cold water inlet   \n[6] Gas supply   \n[7] Shutoff gas valve   \n[8] Hot water outlet   \n[9] Pressure relief valve   \n[10] SS flexible hoses   \n[11] Grundfos cross-over valve (X2)   \n[12] AquaMotion AMK-ODR valve \n\nTank loading \n\nThis recirculation option gives the option of using one of three temperature sensors to control the recirculation option.

Temperature readings will be made at the appliance. \n\nFor more information how to program each menu, see chapter 6.5.2, page 49. \n\nPump performance curve, shown in Fig. 32, is an extra information for Locally Licensed Professional. \n\n4.12 Space heating applications \n\nDANGER: \n\nRisk of scalding! \n\n▶ If the set point temperature is above $1 2 0 \\%$ $( 4 9 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } )$ , precautions should be taken to protect users of potable water from scalding. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ The use of a flow switch is recommended to ensure DHW priority and to prevent “cold-blow” situations when the Bosch tankless water heater is used with an air handler. Air handler installation must include a pump. The flow switch should be used to disable the blower on the air-handling system when domestic water is used. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ Ensure the primary pump is properly sized to provide adequate flow for the system heat load. \n\nFor external pump sizing please refer to the pressure drop curves, fig. 34. Also remember to account for system piping pressure loss. A minimum of 1.7 GPM is recommended to provide adequate flow through the water heater when determining the size of the primary pump. \n\nGreentherm T9900 SE/i tankless water heaters are approved for use in combination DHW and space heating applications (open loop setup). \n\nThese water heaters are not approved for use in space heating only applications (closed-loop setup). Bosch supports applications of combination DHW and space heating in an open loop configuration if plumbed in compliance with Fig. 33. Please see warranty document for additional details. \n\nApplications of combined DHW and space heating in an open loop configuration, when combined with recirculation are not recommended and desired performance is not guaranteed. These applications will require special configurations to ensure proper interaction between the different sub-systems (e.g. Air Handler, Mixing valve, etc.). \n\n4.13 Measuring gas pressure \n\n4.13.1 Gas supply pressure \n\nConfirm gas pressure upon installation. \n\nConnecting manometer \n\n▶ Shut off gas supply at installer supplied shutoff valve for this water heater.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Locate the inlet gas pressure test port (see Fig. 35).   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Loosen the screw inside test port fitting (do not remove) and connect the manometer tube to the test port (see Fig. 35). \n\nStatic Pressure Test \n\n▶ Turn the gas supply back on.   \n▶ Record the static gas pressure reading in table 21. \n\nDynamic Pressure Test \n\n▶ Turn ON the appliance.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Access menu P1 Max.

Wi-Fi module is located on the back side of HMI. \n\n7 Maintenance and service \n\nDANGER: \n\nAlways shut off the electrical power supply, shut off the manual gas valve and shut off the water valves before servicing. \n\nDANGER: \n\nRisk of explosion! \n\nReplace all dismantled seals and o-rings with new ones. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ Inspect the complete water heating system once a year.   \n▶ Follow points 5 and 6 in Table 24 after 400 operation hours or 25000 cycles (whichever occurs first), see chapter 6.5.1(Data History).   \n▶ Inspect the water heater and components for wear or fatigue. Immediately repair all faults to avoid damage to the system.   \n1) Proceed with air filter cleaning or replacement if error code CE, CF and C2 is displayed. Check the flue exhaust for blockage (appliance is protected against flue blockage).   \n2) Proceed with heat exchanger descaling whenever error codes AA and E5 are displayed (appliance is protected against over heating in case of scaling), see table 17 Water Quality. \n\nTable 24 Annual maintenance \n\n7.1 Required annual maintenance \n\n(To remove front cover, see page 12) \n\nWARNING: \n\nMaintenance must be done by a Locally Licensed Professional. \n\nVenting System \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ For horizontally vented appliances, keep the area around the venting system free of snow or ice to prevent blockage. \n\nVenting system blocked! \n\n• Venting system - Inspect inside of flue pipe and remove any blockage or restriction. Observe burner flames during heater operation (front cover must be removed). Burner flames should be steady and blue. Yellow, inconsistent (bouncing) flames may be an indication of poor ventilation or combustion air supply. Inspect the combustion air intake pipe and remove any blockage or debris. Inspect air intake and exhaust terminations and remove any blockage or debris. \n\nHeat Exchanger \n\n• Inspect burner observation window for cracks or spillage of flue gases. Observe burner flames during heater operation. Flames should be steady and blue with no signs of yellowing. Yellow burner flames are an indication of improper combustion. Refer to section 4.6 to verify the exhaust system and combustion air supply meets the manufacturer's specifications. \n\nPressure Relief \n\n• Manually open the pressure relief valve to ensure proper operation, make sure discharge drains away safely. \n\nInlet Water Filter \n\n• Verify the inlet water filter screen is clean and undamaged. The inlet water filter is located on the top of the appliance, at the cold water inlet connection. (See Fig. 29, page 38). Close the installer supplied water shutoff valve purge the water using discharge drains and remove the brass hex cap holding filter. Remove the filter, clean and/ or replace if damaged. \n\nDescaling \n\n• In areas where the water supply has a high mineral content (see table 17 Water Quality) the heat exchanger should be flushed with a descaling solution. Scale build up will \n\nshorten the life of the water heater and damage resulting from scale is not covered under warranty. Refer to section 7.3 for detailed instructions on descaling the heat exchanger. \n\nCondensate Siphon \n\n• Check for debris and clean if needed. \n\nAir Filter \n\n• Verify if the air filter is clean and undamaged. The air filter is attached to the fan assembly, see fig. 54. Air filter must be cleaned or replaced in case it is clogged or damaged. \n\nHow to remove/assembly air filter \n\n▶ Disconnect the electrical supply from the water heater.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Remove appliance front cover, see page 12.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Remove cover from the air filter.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Loosen two philips head screws.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Remove air filter from the fan.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Clean filter with soft toothbrush, do not use water or compressed air.   \n▶ Proceed in the reverse order for assembly. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nAppliance malfunction! \n\nAir filter should not be removed during appliance normal operation as, as it may increase the risk of burner blockage. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nRisk of burner blockage! \n\n▶ Paper filter (part # 8738725270) installed on the air fan for increased protection against dusty, dirty combustion air or heavy pollen entering the combustion chamber to reduce the risk of burner blockage. Maintenance frequency might need to be adjusted to keep the filter clean and allow a good performance of the heater. \n\n7.2 Winterizing for seasonal use \n\nThe water heater must not be installed in a location where it may be exposed to freezing temperatures unless connected to electrical power. All water must be drained from the heater in order to avoid damage to the unit from exposure to freezing temperatures. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nUse of agents such as anti-freeze is not permitted and voids the warranty, as they may cause damage to the water heater's internal components. \n\n1. Hold ON/OFF switch on the water heater for 3 secs. to turn OFF the heater and unplug the power supply cord. The display should be blank.   \n2. Shut off the gas supply to the water heater.   \n3. Shut off the water supply to the water heater using installer supplied shutoff valve.   \n4. Open hot water faucets to drain and relieve pressure from the plumbing system. If water continues to flow after 5 minutes, a crossover of the hot and cold water pipes is present and must be corrected before proceeding.   \n5. Disconnect the inlet and outlet water pipes from the water heater. Place a small bucket underneath the water heater to catch residual water remaining inside the water heater.   \n6. Using an air compressor, blow short bursts of air (50psi max) through the inlet water connection or inlet water filter until there is no water present coming through the outlet water connection of the heater.   \n7. Empty condensate trap.   \n8. Reconnect the water fittings and return the heater to service when danger of freezing has passed. \n\n7.3 Mineral scale build-up \n\nPeriodic descaling may be necessary in areas with high mineral content in the water (See table 17 Water Quality). Scale buildup in the heat exchanger may result in lower flow rates, error codes of AA, E3, A5 and boiling sounds in the heat exchanger. \n\nA water softener is required if the water hardness exceeds 12 grains/gal $( 2 0 0 \\mathsf { m g } / | )$ calcium carbonate. Damage to the water heater resulting from hard water/scale deposits will not be covered under warranty. \n\nDescaling using a pump \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ Disconnect the electrical supply from the water heater.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Shut off the water supply to the water heater.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Open hot water faucets to drain and relieve pressure from the plumbing system. Shut off hot water valve to the water heater. Remove the caps from both inlet and outlet drain connections. Connect a line (A) from the outlet of the circulating pump (installer supplied) to the inlet drain connection on the water heater (see fig. 55.)   \n▶ Using another line (B), connect the outlet drain connection on the water heater. Route the other end of this line into a descaling reservoir.   \n▶ Using a 3rd line (C) from the descaling reservoir, connect to the inlet side of circulating pump. Install a filter on the end of the line in the descaling reservoir.   \n▶ Make sure all connections are water tight.   \n▶ Fill the descaling reservoir with descaling solution so both lines inside are submersed. We recommend a straight white vinegar solution. If using a commercial descalant, refer to manufacturer's instructions for proper dilution ratio.   \n▶ Ensure both drain connections are open.   \n▶ Operate the circulating pump. Make sure there are no leaks and the solution is flowing from the descaling reservoir through the heater and returning to the reservoir. Run the solution through the heater until the solution returning to the descaling reservoir comes out clear. (Changing to a fresh solution may be necessary during this process). Disconnect all lines and drain all solution from heat exchanger. Properly discard the solution.   \n▶ Attach the cap to the inlet drain connection to close it. Position a container below the outlet drain connection and connect the cold water supply. Open the cold water supply shutoff valve and flush the heat exchanger with clean water.   \n▶ Close the cold water shutoff valve and reconnect hot water supply to the water heater.   \n▶ Attach the cap to the outlet drain connection to close it. \n\n▶ Reconnect the electrical supply to the unit, open the water shutoff valves, and return the unit to service. \n\n[1] Pump [2] Water filter \n\n8 Troubleshooting \n\nWARNING: \n\n▶ If you are unable to perform the tasks listed below, or need additional assistance please contact a Locally Licensed Professional. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nIn some areas local code may require that the tasks described in this section must be performed by a Locally Licensed Professional. \n\nPlease check your local codes to ensure compliance. \n\n8.1 Introduction \n\nMany of the questions customers ask regarding operation of this unit can be answered by following the troubleshooting steps as outlined below. For best results, perform each step before proceeding to the next. The suggested solutions may require that the cover be taken off (see fig. 3, page 12). \n\n8.2 Burner does not ignite when a hot water faucet is opened \n\nIt is recommended to use “P4 Information” page 48, chapter 6.5.1 as a tool for problem solving. \n\n1. If the display is blank, verify power at the outlet. (120VAC/   \n60Hz properly grounded circuit required). Confirm power to the heater. Check all wire connections including plugged connectors.   \n2. Verify the fuse in the control board is good. To access the fuse, the control board must be removed. See chapter 5.2, page 45.   \n3. Make sure cold water inlet connection is plumbed to the right side of the heater when facing unit. See fig. 28, page 38.   \n4. A minimum of 0.45 gallons per minute $( 1 . 7 | / \\mathsf { m } )$ of hot water demand is required to activate the heater. Confirm at least 0.4 gpm flow by timing how long it takes to fill a container. A quart container should fill in 20 seconds or less, from the hot water faucet only. Gradually increase water flow (hot water demand) through the heater to determine if the heater activates with higher flow.   \n5. Clean the inlet water filter screen per chapter 4.10, page 37.   \n6. Inspect the water path for obstructions. Make sure all shower heads, faucet aerators and whole house filters are clear of debris.   \n7. Check for a plumbing crossover. A crossover in the hot and cold plumbing pipes creates back pressure on the water flowing through the heater. Therefore, a higher flow rate than normal is needed to force the heater to activate. To check for a plumbing crossover, shut off the cold water supply to the water heater. Then open all of the hot water faucets served by the water heater. Wait 10 minutes and check for water flow at each faucet. There should be no water flowing. Any continuous flow of water, small or large, indicates a crossover is present and must be corrected. Consult a professional plumber for help in correcting a crossover. Failing single lever faucet mixing valves are common causes of plumbing crossovers.   \n8. With the water heater's power supply cord unplugged, remove the unit's front cover (See fig. 3, page 12). Check all wire connections between the water valve, control unit and electrode set fig. 68, page 74).   \n9. Check all wire connections between the water valve/water flow sensor, control unit and electrode set. See chapter 10, page 74. \n\n8.3 Water is too hot \n\n1. Selected temperature on the unit is too high. To lower output temperature, see chapter 6.4, page 46. \n\n2. Confirm the heater's gas type coincides with the type of gas being supplied. See fig. 2, page 12 for location of rating plate. \n\n8.4 Water is not hot enough \n\n1. Selected temperature on the unit is too low. To raise output temperature, see chapter 6.4, page 46.   \n2. Confirm the heater's gas type coincides with the type of gas being supplied. See fig. 2, page 12 for location of rating plate.   \n3. Verify gas pressure is in accordance with specifications in chapter 4.13, page 44. A gas pressure reading is needed to proceed further. Contact your Locally Licensed Professional or a local certified gas technician to obtain this reading.   \n4. Check inlet gas particle screen/filter for blockage at inlet gas valve. Need to remove gas valve from the appliance.   \n5. Cold water is mixing into the hot water lines (plumbing crossover). A plumbing crossover can unintentionally mix cold water with the hot water leaving the heater. The end result is a cooler water temperature than desired. To check for a plumbing crossover, shut off the cold water supply to the water heater. Then open all of the hot water faucets served by the heater. Wait 10 minutes and check all faucets for water flow. There should be no water flowing. Any continuous flow of water, small or large, indicates a crossover and must be corrected. Consult a professional plumber for help in correcting a crossover. Failing single lever faucet mixing valves are common causes of plumbing crossovers. \n\n8.5 Low water flow/pressure \n\n1. Too many hot water applications are being used simultaneously or too much flow is demanded. The water heater will effectively support two 2.0-2.5 GPM shower heads simultaneously or multiple sink applications. Greater draws will result in a water pressure drop and reduced flow at faucets.   \n2. If the selected temperature on the unit is set too high for the demanded flow rate, the water heater will close its motorized water valve, reducing the hot water flow rate in an attempt to reach the selected output temperature. Lowering the selected temperature will allow the motorized water valve to open up for increased water flow rate.   \n3. Clean inlet filter screen as instructed in chapter 7.1, page 58 to increase flow through the heater.   \n4. Inspect the water path for obstructions. Make sure all shower heads, faucet aerators and whole house filters are clear of debris. It may be necessary to upgrade to higher flow rate shower heads if allowed by local code. \n\n5. In areas where the water has a high mineral content, periodic descaling may necessary. See chapter 7.3, page 59 for directions. \n\n8.6 Hot water temperature fluctuates at faucet \n\n1. If the water heater set point temperature is high, mixing at the faucet could deactivate the water heater. The addition of too much cold will overpower hot water flow from the tankless water heater reducing its flow below the activation point. If this slows the flow through the tankless water heater below its activation point, it will shut off the burner.   \n2. Unbalanced pressure in water lines. Any restriction in the water heater, such as a clogged inlet water filter screen, can result in unequal pressures between the cold and hot water lines. In such cases, when mixing in the higher pressure cold water at the faucet, the lower pressure hot water can be overpowered. This will shut down the burners because the hot water flow rate falls below the minimum flow rate required for activation. Verify that the inlet water filter screen is clean and clear of debris. See chapter 7.1, page 58 for inlet water filter cleaning instructions.   \n3. The water heater may be deactivated by temperature balancing shower valves. If the water heater's set point temperature is set too high, the temperature balance shower valve will automatically mix in cold water to reduce the hot water temperature. An adjustment should be made to minimize the amount of cold water the valve is adding. Additionally, the temperature setting on the water heater can be lowered to reduce the amount of cold water that the temperature balance valve mixes in.   \n4. Inlet water pressure is erratic due to fluctuating supply water pressure. For installation on a private well system with the use of a pressure tank, the lowest pressure range setting recommended is 30 - 45 psi (2.06 - 3.1 bar). Consult your Locally Licensed Professional or local plumber for effective ways to maintain constant water pressure to the appliance when on a well system. \n\n8.7 Noisy burner/heater during operation \n\nBurner noises can be heard if combustion is not properly set. This could be caused by improper gas supply conditions (gas pressure and/or gas composition). Two types of noise can be heard: low pitch noise/vibration (rumbling) and high pitch noise/vibration (whistling). \n\n8.7.1 High pitch noise \n\n1. Verify if correct gas type is selected (see section 6.8). 2. Verify is gas pressure is within specified range (see section 3.2). \n\n3. Ensure that the venting used is according to specifications (see section 4.6) and cross contamination does not exist. Ensure that intake and exhaust terminations maintain required clearances. If gas type is properly selected, gas pressure is within range, the venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \n4. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \n\n8.7.2 Low pitch noise \n\n1. Verify if correct gas type is selected (see section 6.8).   \n2. Verify if gas pressure is within specified range (see section 3.2). If gas type is properly selected, gas pressure is within range, the venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \n3. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \n\n8.8 Error codes C1, C2, CF and/or CE \n\nC1, C2, CF and CE errors could be caused by a too long flue and/or an obstruction in the venting. \n\n1. Verify if there are any venting obstructions and remove them if that is the case.   \n2. Ensure that the venting used is according to specifications (see section 4.6).   \n3. Reset the error by holding the On/Off button for 3s. If there are no obstructions and venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \n4. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \n\n8.9 Error codes EA and/or EC \n\nEA and EC errors can appear if combustion is not properly set. This could be caused by improper gas supply conditions (gas pressure and/or gas composition). \n\n1. Verify if correct gas type is selected (see section 6.8).   \n2. Verify is gas pressure is within specified range (see section 3.2). If gas type is properly selected, gas pressure is within range, the venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \n3. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \n\n8.10 Internal recirculation pump \n\n1. Pump makes noise. Purge the recirculation water circuit. \n\n2. How to verify the recirculation flow. Close all water faucets, access to information menu, P4 information $>$ Operation Data, choose the option Flow. \n\nThe value should be above 1 GPM $( 4 | / \\mathsf { m i n } )$ \n\n3. If the appliance doesn’t make the recirculation. Confirm if recirculation mode is active, inspect the recirculation circuit and water filter for any obstructions, ensure that the recirculation circuit is fill with water, verify if the recirculation circuit is below the maximum pipe length, see table 18. \n\n8.11 Manifold gas pressure \n\nThe manifold gas pressure measurement is only carried out if it is necessary to confirm the value from the rating plate. In case of a high deviation between measured and stated values, please proceed with Gas/air adjustment (see section 8.12) 1). \n\n▶ Turn Off the appliance.   \n▶ Remove the front cover of the appliance (see page 12). \n\n[A] Air pressure head in the box [B] Gas pressure head in the burner [C] Tee (installer supplied) \n\n1) Manifold gas pressure from the rating plate is valid for sea level operation with standard gas pressure and composition. If operating conditions are different from those, values from section 8.12 should prevail over manifold gas pressure to assure a correct appliance tuning. \n\n▶ Loosen the set screw of the pressure head point [B].   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Connect the pressure gauge connection \"+\" to the test point [B].   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Connect the pressure gauge \"-\" to the pressure head point [A] using the accessory [C].   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Turn On the appliance.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Position the front cover near the appliance and make sure the cable for the display is connected.

No.168, Yung Chi Rd., Taipei, 110 Taiwan All rights reserved except as specified below. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is forbidden. \n\nPreamble \n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the ARPHIC PUBLIC LICENSE specifically permits and encourages you to use this software, provided that you give the recipients all the rights that we gave you and make sure they can get the modifications of this software. \n\nLegal Terms \n\nDefinitions: \n\nThroughout this License, \"Font\" means the TrueType fonts \"AR PL Mingti2L Big5\", \"AR PL KaitiM Big5\" (BIG-5 character set) and \"AR PL SungtiL GB\", \"AR PL KaitiM GB\" (GB character set) which are originally distributed by Arphic, and the derivatives of those fonts created through any modification including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting some characters in/ from glyph table. \n\n\"PL\" means \"Public License\". \n\n\"Copyright Holder\" means whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the Font. \n\n\"You\" means the licensee, or person copying, redistributing or modifying the Font. \n\n\"Freely Available\" means that you have the freedom to copy or modify the Font as well as redistribute copies of the Font under the same conditions you received, not price. If you wish, you can charge for this service. \n\nCopying & Distribution \n\nYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this Font in any medium, without restriction, provided that you retain this \n\nModification \n\nYou may otherwise modify your copy of this Font in any way, including modifying glyph, reordering glyph, converting format, changing font name, or adding/deleting some characters in/from glyph table, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that the following conditions are met: \n\nYou must insert a prominent notice in each modified file stating how and when you changed that file. \n\nYou must make such modifications Freely Available as a whole to all third parties under the terms of this License, such as by offering access to copy the modifications from a designated place, or distributing the modifications on a medium customarily used for software interchange. \n\nIf the modified fonts normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the Font under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. \n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Font, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. Therefore, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Font with the Font on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. \n\nCondition Subsequent \n\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Font except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Font will automatically retroactively void your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License will keep their licenses valid so long as such parties remain in full compliance. \n\nAcceptance \n\nYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Font. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by copying, modifying, sublicensing or distributing the Font, you indicate your acceptance of this License and all its terms and conditions. \n\nAutomatic Receipt \n\nEach time you redistribute the Font, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Font subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. \n\nContradiction \n\nIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Font at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Font by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Font. \n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. \n\nNO WARRANTY \n\nBECAUSE THE FONT IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE FONT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE FONT \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE FONT IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE FONT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. DAMAGES WAIVER UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY COPYRIGHTT HOLDERS, OR OTHER PARTIES WHO MAY COPY, MODIFY OR REDISTRIBUTE THE FONT AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY \n\nDIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDERS OR OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \n\n15.2 SIL Open Font License 1.1 \n\nSIL OPEN FONT LICENSE \n\nVersion 1.1 - 26 February 2007 \n\nPREAMBLE \n\nThe goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others. \n\nThe OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves.
