comparison of two types of transmission pressure sensors: high-pressure and medium-pressure variants. The table is organized with the first column listing technical attributes, and the subsequent columns detailing the specifications for each sensor type. The column headers are 'high-pressure' and 'medium-pressure', indicating the sensor's operational pressure range. Key attributes include mounting place, technology, circuit type, output signal, connector type, electrical characteristics, pressure range, fault diagnostics, range test, and sealing method. \n\nThe high-pressure sensor can be mounted 'in or on transmission', while the medium-pressure sensor's mounting place is unspecified, suggesting possible flexibility or a focus on the high-pressure variant's versatility. The high-pressure sensor uses a 'steel membrane with metal thin-film with Wheatstone strain gauges on top and hermetic' technology, indicating robust construction for demanding environments. In contrast, the medium-pressure sensor employs a 'silicium membrane bridge for signal processing', which may offer advantages in sensitivity or cost. Both sensors utilize digital circuits and provide analog (digital) output signals, supporting integration with modern transmission control units (TCUs). Both feature oil-tight connectors and operate at 5V, ensuring compatibility and reliability in automotive environments. The pressure range is a key differentiator: 7MPa for high-pressure and 2.5MPa for medium-pressure, aligning with their intended applications. Fault diagnostics are explicitly mentioned for the high-pressure sensor ('by way of a signal'), while the medium-pressure sensor omits this detail, possibly indicating a difference in diagnostic capabilities. Both sensors support a 'range test' and use O-ring sealing for fluid integrity.\n\nStatistically, the table highlights that both sensor types share several core features (output, connector, voltage, sealing), but differ in pressure range, sensing technology, and possibly diagnostic features. The high-pressure sensor is designed for more demanding applications, as reflected in its higher pressure rating and robust construction. The table supports the surrounding content by illustrating the flexibility, precision, and reliability of Bosch transmission pressure sensors, as well as their adaptability to different transmission types and installation requirements. It concretely demonstrates how sensor variants address diverse technical needs in automotive transmissions, reinforcing the product benefits and technical explanations provided in the context.\n######################\nOutput:",

header row. The first column lists technical attributes, while the second and third columns compare the 'active' and 'inductive' variants of transmission speed sensors, respectively. The column headers are: (blank, used for attribute names), 'active', and 'inductive'. The rows detail: (1) Function principle, (2) Temperature range, and (3) Trigger wheel compatibility. The 'active' sensor uses a differential Hall effect principle (multiple Hall principle), with optional rotation direction recognition, while the 'inductive' sensor operates on an inductive principle. The active sensor supports a wider temperature range (-40 to +150℃) compared to the inductive sensor (-40 to +130℃), indicating greater thermal robustness. For trigger wheels, the active sensor is compatible with a generic 'trigger wheel', whereas the inductive sensor specifically supports 'steel or multipole steel trigger wheels', suggesting more flexibility in trigger wheel design for the inductive variant. Statistically, the active sensor offers a 20℃ higher maximum operating temperature, which aligns with the surrounding content's emphasis on robust design and flexible use. The table illustrates the relationship between sensor type and technical capabilities, supporting the context's discussion of product benefits such as high measuring precision, reliability, and adaptability to different transmission types. The data highlights that the active variant is more suitable for environments with higher temperature demands and where rotation direction recognition is required, while the inductive variant excels in applications needing high output at low speed and position-independent mounting. This comparison directly supports the surrounding content's explanation of the functional and design differences between sensor types, reinforcing the product's versatility and suitability for various transmission applications.\n######################\nOutput:",

a header row. The first column lists technical attributes, while the second and third columns compare the 'active' and 'inductive' variants of transmission speed sensors, respectively. The column headers are: (blank, used for attribute names), 'active', and 'inductive'. The rows detail: (1) Function principle, (2) Temperature range, and (3) Trigger wheel compatibility. The 'active' sensor uses a differential Hall effect principle (multiple Hall principle), with optional rotation direction recognition, while the 'inductive' sensor operates on an inductive principle. The active sensor supports a wider temperature range (-40 to +150℃) compared to the inductive sensor (-40 to +130℃), indicating greater thermal robustness. For trigger wheels, the active sensor is compatible with a generic 'trigger wheel', whereas the inductive sensor specifically supports 'steel or multipole steel trigger wheels', suggesting more flexibility in trigger wheel design for the inductive variant. Statistically, the active sensor offers a 20℃ higher maximum operating temperature, which aligns with the surrounding content's emphasis on robust design and flexible use. The table illustrates the relationship between sensor type and technical capabilities, supporting the context's discussion of product benefits such as high measuring precision, reliability, and adaptability to different transmission types. The data highlights that the active variant is more suitable for environments with higher temperature demands and where rotation direction recognition is required, while the inductive variant excels in applications needing high output at low speed and position-independent mounting. This comparison directly supports the surrounding content's explanation of the functional and design differences between sensor types, reinforcing the product's versatility and suitability for various transmission applications.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Active Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The active transmission speed sensor is a variant described in the table, characterized by using a differential Hall (multiple Hall principle) with or without rotation direction recognition, supporting a temperature range of -40 to +150℃, and compatible with a trigger wheel.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Inductive Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The inductive transmission speed sensor is a variant described in the table, operating on an inductive principle, supporting a temperature range of -40 to +130℃, and compatible with steel or multipole steel trigger wheels.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Differential Hall Principle\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The differential Hall (multiple Hall principle) is the function principle used by the active transmission speed sensor, with optional rotation direction recognition.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Inductive Principle\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The inductive principle is the function principle used by the inductive transmission speed sensor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Trigger Wheel\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"A trigger wheel is a component compatible with the active transmission speed sensor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Steel or Multipole Steel Trigger Wheel\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Steel or multipole steel trigger wheels are components compatible with the inductive transmission speed sensor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"-40 to +150℃\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"This is the temperature range supported by the active transmission speed sensor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"-40 to +130℃\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"This is the temperature range supported by the inductive transmission speed sensor.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Transmission speed sensor is the general product category being compared in the table, with variants including active and inductive types.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Active Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"Differential Hall Principle\\\"<|>\\\"The active transmission speed sensor uses the differential Hall (multiple Hall) principle as its function principle.\\\"<|>\\\"sensor technology, function principle\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Inductive Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"Inductive Principle\\\"<|>\\\"The inductive transmission speed sensor operates on the inductive principle.\\\"<|>\\\"sensor technology, function principle\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Active Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"-40 to +150℃\\\"<|>\\\"The active transmission speed sensor supports a temperature range of -40 to +150℃.\\\"<|>\\\"operating conditions, temperature range\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Inductive Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"-40 to +130℃\\\"<|>\\\"The inductive transmission speed sensor supports a temperature range of -40 to +130℃.\\\"<|>\\\"operating conditions, temperature range\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Active Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"Trigger Wheel\\\"<|>\\\"The active transmission speed sensor is compatible with a trigger wheel.\\\"<|>\\\"component compatibility, sensor application\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Inductive Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"Steel or Multipole Steel Trigger Wheel\\\"<|>\\\"The inductive transmission speed sensor is compatible with steel or multipole steel trigger wheels.\\\"<|>\\\"component compatibility, sensor application\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"Active Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"The active transmission speed sensor is a variant of the transmission speed sensor category.\\\"<|>\\\"product variant, sensor type\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"Inductive Transmission Speed Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"The inductive transmission speed sensor is a variant of the transmission speed sensor category.\\\"<|>\\\"product variant, sensor type\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"sensor technology, transmission speed sensor, active sensor, inductive sensor, technical comparison, temperature range, trigger wheel compatibility, function principle\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

comparison of two types of transmission pressure sensors: high-pressure and medium-pressure variants. The table is organized with the first column listing technical attributes, and the subsequent columns detailing the specifications for each sensor type. The column headers are 'high-pressure' and 'medium-pressure', indicating the sensor's operational pressure range. Key attributes include mounting place, technology, circuit type, output signal, connector type, electrical characteristics, pressure range, fault diagnostics, range test, and sealing method. \\n\\nThe high-pressure sensor can be mounted 'in or on transmission', while the medium-pressure sensor's mounting place is unspecified, suggesting possible flexibility or a focus on the high-pressure variant's versatility. The high-pressure sensor uses a 'steel membrane with metal thin-film with Wheatstone strain gauges on top and hermetic' technology, indicating robust construction for demanding environments. In contrast, the medium-pressure sensor employs a 'silicium membrane bridge for signal processing', which may offer advantages in sensitivity or cost. Both sensors utilize digital circuits and provide analog (digital) output signals, supporting integration with modern transmission control units (TCUs). Both feature oil-tight connectors and operate at 5V, ensuring compatibility and reliability in automotive environments. The pressure range is a key differentiator: 7MPa for high-pressure and 2.5MPa for medium-pressure, aligning with their intended applications. Fault diagnostics are explicitly mentioned for the high-pressure sensor ('by way of a signal'), while the medium-pressure sensor omits this detail, possibly indicating a difference in diagnostic capabilities. Both sensors support a 'range test' and use O-ring sealing for fluid integrity.\\n\\nStatistically, the table highlights that both sensor types share several core features (output, connector, voltage, sealing), but differ in pressure range, sensing technology, and possibly diagnostic features. The high-pressure sensor is designed for more demanding applications, as reflected in its higher pressure rating and robust construction. The table supports the surrounding content by illustrating the flexibility, precision, and reliability of Bosch transmission pressure sensors, as well as their adaptability to different transmission types and installation requirements. It concretely demonstrates how sensor variants address diverse technical needs in automotive transmissions, reinforcing the product benefits and technical explanations provided in the context.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"High-Pressure Transmission Pressure Sensor\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The high-pressure transmission pressure sensor is a type of sensor designed to be mounted in or on a transmission.

Never leave such individuals in the tub or shower unattended under any circumstances. Children must not be allowed to operate hot water faucets themselves.   \n▶ If the building has occupants in the above groups who operate hot water faucets, or state laws / local ordinances stipulate specific water temperatures, take the following precautions: – Use the lowest possible temperature setting. \n\n– To prevent scalding, install a tempering device, such as an \n\nautomatic mixing valve, at hot   \nwater faucet or water heater.   \nSelect and install the automatic mixing valve in accordance with the valve manufacturer's   \nrecommendations and   \ninstructions. \n\n▶ Water exiting from drain valves can be extremely hot. To avoid injuries: – Check that all connections are tight. – Direct exiting water away from people. \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ Measures must be taken to protect against excessive temperature and pressure! Installation of a T&P safety valve is required. \n\nH WARNING: Electrical safety \n\nTo protect against corrosion and ensure compliance with the rules for electrical safety, observe the following points: \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ Use metal fittings for potable water heating systems with plastic piping. $\\blacktriangleright$ Use only original accessories from the manufacturer. $\\blacktriangleright$ When installation of the water heater is complete, inspect and confirm proper ground conductor. \n\nH CAUTION: Maintenance \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ Inspect and maintain the water heater on a yearly basis. Service as needed. See chapter 7.1. \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ Use only genuine spare parts. \n\nH WARNING: Flooding \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ After a flood, do not use the appliance if any part has been submerged. Damage to appliances that have been submerged can be quite severe and pose numerous safety risks. $\\blacktriangleright$ Every appliance that has been submerged must be replaced. \n\nH WARNING: Risk of explosion! For your safety \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ Do not store or use gasoline or other flammable, combustible or corrosive vapors and liquids in the vicinity of this or any other appliance. \n\nDANGER: \n\nFatal accidents!\n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning. \n\n▶ Carefully plan where you install the heater. Correct combustion air supply and flue pipe installation are very important. If a gas appliance is not installed correctly, fatal accidents can result such as carbon monoxide poisoning or fire. \n\nDANGER: \n\nCarbon monoxide poisoning. \n\n▶ Exhaust gas must be vented to outside using approved vent material. See table 5, page 19 (In Canada use only ULCS636 approved material). Vent and combustion air connector piping must be sealed gas-tight to prevent flue gas spillage, carbon monoxide emissions and risk of fire, resulting in severe personal injury or death. Approved vent terminations must be used. \n\nDANGER: \n\nElectric shock! \n\n▶ Field wiring connections and electrical grounding must comply with local codes, or in the absence of local codes, with the latest edition of the National Electric Code, ANSI/ NFPA 70, or in Canada, all electrical wiring must comply with the local codes and the Canadian Electrical Code, CSA C22.1 Part 1. \n\nDANGER: \n\nElectric shock! \n\nShock hazard: line voltage is present. \n\n▶ Before servicing the water heater, unplug power supply cord from outlet. Failure to do so could result in severe personal injury or death. \n\nWARNING: \n\nDamage to the appliance from over pressure. \n\n▶ The heater must be disconnected from the gas supply piping system during any pressure testing of that system at test pressures equal to or more than 0.5 psi. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ The appliance should be located in an area where leakage of the heater or connections will not result in damage to the area adjacent to the appliance or to lower floors of the structure. When such locations cannot be avoided, it is recommended that a suitable drain pan, adequately drained, be installed under the appliance. The pan must not restrict combustion air flow. \n\nWARNING: \n\n▶ The maximum inlet gas pressure must not exceed the value specified by the manufacturer and the minimum value listed is for the purpose of input adjustment. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ If a water heater is installed in a closed water supply system, such as one having a backflow preventer in the cold water supply line, means shall be provided to control thermal expansion. Contact the water supplier or local plumbing inspector on how to control this situation. \n\nWARNING: \n\nFire danger! \n\n▶ Keep appliance area clear and free from combustible materials, gasoline and other flammable vapors and liquids. \n\nWARNING: \n\nRisk of CO poisoning! \n\n▶ Do not obstruct the flow of combustion and ventilation air. \n\nDANGER: \n\nRisk of scalding and property damage. \n\n▶ Precautions must be taken prior to manually operating the relief valve to avoid contact with hot water discharged from the relief valve and to prevent water damage. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nAppliance damage! \n\n▶ Label all wires prior to disconnection when servicing controls. Wiring errors can result in improper and dangerous operation. Verify proper operation after servicing. \n\nWARNING: \n\nRelief valve discharges! \n\nIf a relief valve discharges periodically, this may be due to thermal expansion in a closed water supply system. Contact the water supplier or local plumbing inspector on how to correct this situation. Do not plug the relief valve. \n\nWARNING: \n\nPersonal Injury from toxic chemicals. \n\n▶ Toxic chemicals, such as those used for boiler treatment, shall not be introduced into the potable water used for space heating. \n\nWARNING: \n\nPersonal Injury from toxic chemicals. \n\nA water heater which will be used to supply potable water shall not be connected to any heating system or component(s) previously used with a nonpotable water heating appliance. \n\n2 Safety information \n\nThe chart below shows the relationship between water temperature and time until there is a risk of scalding.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\\n\\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \\\"If this tech can be understood...\\\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \\\"It could change the game for us.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Before starting up the heater for the first time, be certain you have the heater correctly set for your type of Gas - Propane or Natural Gas. Identification labels are found on the shipping box, and on the rating plate which is located on the left side (when facing appliance front) of the cover. \n\n[1] Serial number [2] Type of gas (Natural gas by default) \n\n3.3.1 The box includes \n\n• Water Heater LP Conversion Kit Pressure relief valve Bracket and screws for wall hanging the heater Installation manual (manual can be downloaded at www.boschheatingandcooling.com) \n\nThe Greentherm T9900 SE/i are not approved or designed for: \n\n• Manufactured (mobile) homes, boats or any mobile installation. (Modular homes are acceptable for installation). Use above 8000 ft A.S.L. altitude. Applications where inlet water temperature is higher than $140 ^ { \\circ } F$ $( 6 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathfrak { C } )$ for Residential appliances. In these applications a 3 way valve or thermostatic mixing valve must be installed. Use with commercial dishwasher pre rinse spray valves. Booster applications.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Slowly open the front cover [1]. \n\nIn preheated inlet water applications (i.e. solar preheat), activation flow rate will vary depending upon the unit set point, inlet water temperature and the demand flow rate thru the unit. Please consult Bosch for further details to determine if this will function in your application. \n\n3.3.2 Remove front cover \n\n▶ Loosen two Phillips head screws located on the bottom of the front cover (fig. 3). \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ Disconnect the wire from the HMI (display) [2].   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Lift the front cover to remove from the appliance.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Install the appliance so that it hangs vertically. \n\n3.4 General rules to follow for safe operation \n\nH Warning: Safety Rules! \n\n1. You must follow these instructions when you install your heater. In the United States: The installation must conform with local codes or, in the absence of local codes, the National Fuel Gas Code ANSI Z223.1/NFPA 54. \n\nIn Canada: The Installation must conform with CSA B149.(1,2) INSTALLATION CODES and /or local installation codes. \n\n2. Carefully plan where you install the heater. Correct combustion air supply and vent pipe installation are very important. If not installed correctly, fatal accidents can occur, such as carbon monoxide poisoning or fire. \n\nWhen the unit is installed indoors with DIRECT VENT (exhaust vent and air intake connected to the outside) it is permitted to be located in bathrooms, bedrooms and occupied rooms that are normally kept closed. See chapter 4.6 (page 18). If the unit will be installed indoors and use indoor combustion air (NON-DIRECT VENT), the place where you install the heater must have enough ventilation. The National Fuel Gas Codes do not allow NON-DIRECT VENT gas fired water heater installations in bathrooms, bedrooms or any occupied rooms normally kept closed. See chapter 4.6 (page 18). \n\n4. You must correctly vent your heater. See chapter 4.6 (page 18) on VENTING. 5. The appliance and its gas connection must be leak tested before placing the appliance in operation. The appliance must be isolated from the gas supply piping system by \n\nclosing its individual manual gas shutoff valve (not supplied with heater) during any pressure testing at pressures in excess of $\\%$ Psig (3.5 kPa). \n\n6. Keep the water heater area clear and free from combustibles and flammable liquids. Do not locate the heater over any material which might burn. \n\n7. Correct gas pressure is critical for the proper operation of this heater. Gas piping must be sized to provide the required pressure at the maximum output of the heater, while all the other gas appliances are in operation. Check with your local gas supplier, and see the section on connecting the gas supply. See chapter 4.8 (page 33). \n\n8. Should overheating occur or the gas supply fail to shut off, turn off the gas supply at the manual gas shut off valve, on the gas line. Note: manual gas shutoff valve is not supplied with the heater but must be field installed. \n\n9. Do not use this appliance if any part has been underwater. Immediately call the responsible party for the installation of your appliance to inspect the appliance and to replace any part of the water heater which has been underwater. \n\n10.Failure to install the heater correctly may lead to unsafe operation. \n\n▶ Improper operation.   \n▶ Loss of warranty. \n\nDANGER: \n\n▶ The water heater must be installed by a Locally Licensed Professional in accordance with these instructions. If improperly installed, a hazardous condition such as explosion or carbon monoxide poisoning could result. Bosch Thermotechnology Corp. is not responsible for improperly installed appliances. \n\nCommon installation practice is to first determine the path and method of venting, then design the piping layout. \n\n4.3 Proper location for installing your heater \n\nCarefully select the location of the water heater. For your safety and for proper heater operation, you must provide combustion air to the heater and properly vent the exhaust gases. Follow the guidelines below: \n\n▶ 1. Locate the heater where venting, gas and plumbing connections are feasible and convenient. $\\blacktriangleright$ 2. The hot water lines should be kept short and insulated to save energy. It is recommended to locate the water heater as close as practical\n######################\nOutput:",

For your safety and for proper heater operation, you must provide combustion air to the heater and properly vent the exhaust gases. Follow the guidelines below: \n\n▶ 1. Locate the heater where venting, gas and plumbing connections are feasible and convenient. $\\blacktriangleright$ 2. The hot water lines should be kept short and insulated to save energy. It is recommended to locate the water heater as close as practical to the most frequently used hot water fixtures. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nFor servicing access, a 2ft clearance is recommended to the front cover. \n\nRisk of appliance freezing! \n\n▶ The water in this water heater is cold and always remains cold except for the times the burner is on. In the event of power outage in conjunction with freezing temperatures, the heater should be drained. See chapter 7.2, page 59 “Winterizing” for draining instructions. \n\n4 Installation instructions \n\n4.1 Installation tools \n\nThe following specialized tools may be required if converting from natural gas to LP: \n\n• Pressure manometer \n\nNOTICE: \n\nInstallation \n\nDo not install the water heater in rooms with a high moisture level (e.g. bathrooms, saunas). \n\n4.2 Introduction \n\nPlease follow these instructions. Failure to follow instructions may result in: \n\n▶ Damage or injury. \n\nWARNING: \n\n▶ Flammable materials, gasoline, pressurized containers, or any other items or articles that are potential fire hazards must NOT be placed on or adjacent to the heater. The appliance area must be kept free of all combustible materials, gasoline and other flammable vapors and liquids. \n\nWARNING: \n\nRisk of blockage! \n\n▶ Excess of solid particles (e.g. bugs, pollen) in the air intake may clog the air filter and lead to premature failure of the heater if not protected accordingly.   \nDo not install the water heater in areas where excess of solid particles may accumulate. \n\n4.4 Heater placement and clearances \n\nThe water heater design is approved for installation on a combustible wall (see chapter 4.5 Mounting installation) provided the floor covering below the heater is noncombustible. \n\nFor installations in an alcove or closet, maintain the minimum clearances to combustible and non-combustible materials. See fig. 6, page 16. \n\n4.5 Hanging appliance on the wall \n\nWARNING: \n\nSevere personal injury and property damage! \n\nBefore mounting appliance: \n\n▶ Check that there are no loose or damaged parts inside the appliance.   \n▶ Set the heater gas type according to the gas supplied to the unit.   \nConfirm that the water heater has been properly setup for the gas type supplied to the unit. See conversion instructions in section 6.8.1 as needed. \n\nFront cover should be removed (see instructions on page 12) in order to inspect components visually. \n\nWARNING: \n\n▶ Do not install this appliance on a carpeted wall. The heater must be mounted on a wall using appropriate anchoring materials. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nRisk of appliance freezing! \n\n▶ In areas where outside temperature is routinely below $3 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { F }$ $( 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } )$ and the heater is to be installed on the inside of an exterior wall, provide a minimum $2 \"$ air gap or rigid insulation between the heater back and the wall. \n\nIf the wall is sheathed with plaster or drywall, it is recommended that two support boards, either 1\"x 4\" or $1 / 2 \"$ (minimum) plywood first be attached across a pair of studs, see fig. 7. \n\n▶ Secure the wall mounting bracket provided with the heater to a wall surface. The heater must be kept level on the wall surface, see fig. 8, page 18.   \n▶ Hang the appliance on the bracket, see fig. 9, page 18. \n\nCAUTION: \n\nPersonal injury and property damage. \n\nAppliance must be installed vertically. \n\n4.6 Venting \n\nDANGER: \n\nFlue gas poisoning! \n\n▶ Do not reduce the exhaust or combustion air vent pipe sizes.   \n▶ Do not common vent with any other vented appliance or stove.   \n▶ Do not use Type-B vent as the actual exhaust vent system for the appliance. \n\nDANGER: \n\nFlue gas poisoning! \n\n▶ Failure to vent the exhaust gases to the outside (see table 5 for proper material) may result in dangerous flue gases filling the structure in which it is installed. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ Installations resulting in negative pressure/back draft require sealed combustion (twin pipe / concentric). Damage caused from back draft, ie. freezing, are not covered by warranty. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nAppliance malfunction! \n\n▶ Protect the inlet air supply from leaves and debris by installing a screen on the intake of the termination. A minimum screen mesh size of $1 / 4 ^ { 1 1 }$ is recommended.   \n▶ Do not install the water heater in areas where dust and chemicals like hair sprays, spray detergents, chlorine, may accumulate. \n\nDo not cover non-metallic vent pipe and fittings with thermal insulation, unless going through an insulated wall or ceiling. \n\nFlue temperature: \n\n▶ To prevent the risk of flue material overheat the appliance's flue temperature is sensed and is limited. The flue temperature limit is dependent on inlet water temperature. ▶ Residential models: Maximum flue temperature is limited to 145 °F $( 6 3 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } )$ . \n\n4.6.1 Vent options \n\nThis appliance can be installed as direct vent or Category IV. The Greentherm T9900 SE/i is approved with the following venting options:\n######################\nOutput:",

Never leave such individuals in the tub or shower unattended under any circumstances. Children must not be allowed to operate hot water faucets themselves.   \\n▶ If the building has occupants in the above groups who operate hot water faucets, or state laws / local ordinances stipulate specific water temperatures, take the following precautions: – Use the lowest possible temperature setting. \\n\\n– To prevent scalding, install a tempering device, such as an \\n\\nautomatic mixing valve, at hot   \\nwater faucet or water heater.   \\nSelect and install the automatic mixing valve in accordance with the valve manufacturer's   \\nrecommendations and   \\ninstructions. \\n\\n▶ Water exiting from drain valves can be extremely hot. To avoid injuries: – Check that all connections are tight. – Direct exiting water away from people. \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Measures must be taken to protect against excessive temperature and pressure! Installation of a T&P safety valve is required. \\n\\nH WARNING: Electrical safety \\n\\nTo protect against corrosion and ensure compliance with the rules for electrical safety, observe the following points: \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Use metal fittings for potable water heating systems with plastic piping. $\\\\blacktriangleright$ Use only original accessories from the manufacturer. $\\\\blacktriangleright$ When installation of the water heater is complete, inspect and confirm proper ground conductor. \\n\\nH CAUTION: Maintenance \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Inspect and maintain the water heater on a yearly basis. Service as needed. See chapter 7.1. \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Use only genuine spare parts. \\n\\nH WARNING: Flooding \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ After a flood, do not use the appliance if any part has been submerged. Damage to appliances that have been submerged can be quite severe and pose numerous safety risks. $\\\\blacktriangleright$ Every appliance that has been submerged must be replaced. \\n\\nH WARNING: Risk of explosion! For your safety \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Do not store or use gasoline or other flammable, combustible or corrosive vapors and liquids in the vicinity of this or any other appliance. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nFatal accidents!\\n\\nCarbon monoxide poisoning. \\n\\n▶ Carefully plan where you install the heater. Correct combustion air supply and flue pipe installation are very important. If a gas appliance is not installed correctly, fatal accidents can result such as carbon monoxide poisoning or fire. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nCarbon monoxide poisoning. \\n\\n▶ Exhaust gas must be vented to outside using approved vent material. See table 5, page 19 (In Canada use only ULCS636 approved material). Vent and combustion air connector piping must be sealed gas-tight to prevent flue gas spillage, carbon monoxide emissions and risk of fire, resulting in severe personal injury or death. Approved vent terminations must be used. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nElectric shock! \\n\\n▶ Field wiring connections and electrical grounding must comply with local codes, or in the absence of local codes, with the latest edition of the National Electric Code, ANSI/ NFPA 70, or in Canada, all electrical wiring must comply with the local codes and the Canadian Electrical Code, CSA C22.1 Part 1. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nElectric shock! \\n\\nShock hazard: line voltage is present. \\n\\n▶ Before servicing the water heater, unplug power supply cord from outlet. Failure to do so could result in severe personal injury or death. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\nDamage to the appliance from over pressure. \\n\\n▶ The heater must be disconnected from the gas supply piping system during any pressure testing of that system at test pressures equal to or more than 0.5 psi. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\n▶ The appliance should be located in an area where leakage of the heater or connections will not result in damage to the area adjacent to the appliance or to lower floors of the structure. When such locations cannot be avoided, it is recommended that a suitable drain pan, adequately drained, be installed under the appliance. The pan must not restrict combustion air flow. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\n▶ The maximum inlet gas pressure must not exceed the value specified by the manufacturer and the minimum value listed is for the purpose of input adjustment. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\n▶ If a water heater is installed in a closed water supply system, such as one having a backflow preventer in the cold water supply line, means shall be provided to control thermal expansion. Contact the water supplier or local plumbing inspector on how to control this situation. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\nFire danger! \\n\\n▶ Keep appliance area clear and free from combustible materials, gasoline and other flammable vapors and liquids. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\nRisk of CO poisoning! \\n\\n▶ Do not obstruct the flow of combustion and ventilation air. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nRisk of scalding and property damage. \\n\\n▶ Precautions must be taken prior to manually operating the relief valve to avoid contact with hot water discharged from the relief valve and to prevent water damage. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nAppliance damage! \\n\\n▶ Label all wires prior to disconnection when servicing controls. Wiring errors can result in improper and dangerous operation. Verify proper operation after servicing. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\nRelief valve discharges! \\n\\nIf a relief valve discharges periodically, this may be due to thermal expansion in a closed water supply system. Contact the water supplier or local plumbing inspector on how to correct this situation. Do not plug the relief valve. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\nPersonal Injury from toxic chemicals. \\n\\n▶ Toxic chemicals, such as those used for boiler treatment, shall not be introduced into the potable water used for space heating. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\nPersonal Injury from toxic chemicals. \\n\\nA water heater which will be used to supply potable water shall not be connected to any heating system or component(s) previously used with a nonpotable water heating appliance. \\n\\n2 Safety information \\n\\nThe chart below shows the relationship between water temperature and time until there is a risk of scalding.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nmanufacturer to operate with Natural Gas, for use with Liquid Propane, a Locally Licensed Professional must follow the conversion instructions in section 6.8.1. Before starting up the heater for the first time, be certain you have the heater correctly set for your type of Gas - Propane or Natural Gas. Identification labels are found on the shipping box, and on the rating plate which is located on the left side (when facing appliance front) of the cover. \\n\\n[1] Serial number [2] Type of gas (Natural gas by default) \\n\\n3.3.1 The box includes \\n\\n• Water Heater LP Conversion Kit Pressure relief valve Bracket and screws for wall hanging the heater Installation manual (manual can be downloaded at www.boschheatingandcooling.com) \\n\\nThe Greentherm T9900 SE/i are not approved or designed for: \\n\\n• Manufactured (mobile) homes, boats or any mobile installation. (Modular homes are acceptable for installation). Use above 8000 ft A.S.L. altitude. Applications where inlet water temperature is higher than $140 ^ { \\\\circ } F$ $( 6 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathfrak { C } )$ for Residential appliances. In these applications a 3 way valve or thermostatic mixing valve must be installed. Use with commercial dishwasher pre rinse spray valves. Booster applications.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Slowly open the front cover [1]. \\n\\nIn preheated inlet water applications (i.e. solar preheat), activation flow rate will vary depending upon the unit set point, inlet water temperature and the demand flow rate thru the unit. Please consult Bosch for further details to determine if this will function in your application. \\n\\n3.3.2 Remove front cover \\n\\n▶ Loosen two Phillips head screws located on the bottom of the front cover (fig. 3). \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Disconnect the wire from the HMI (display) [2].   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Lift the front cover to remove from the appliance.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Install the appliance so that it hangs vertically. \\n\\n3.4 General rules to follow for safe operation \\n\\nH Warning: Safety Rules! \\n\\n1. You must follow these instructions when you install your heater. In the United States: The installation must conform with local codes or, in the absence of local codes, the National Fuel Gas Code ANSI Z223.1/NFPA 54. \\n\\nIn Canada: The Installation must conform with CSA B149.(1,2) INSTALLATION CODES and /or local installation codes. \\n\\n2. Carefully plan where you install the heater. Correct combustion air supply and vent pipe installation are very important. If not installed correctly, fatal accidents can occur, such as carbon monoxide poisoning or fire. \\n\\nWhen the unit is installed indoors with DIRECT VENT (exhaust vent and air intake connected to the outside) it is permitted to be located in bathrooms, bedrooms and occupied rooms that are normally kept closed. See chapter 4.6 (page 18). If the unit will be installed indoors and use indoor combustion air (NON-DIRECT VENT), the place where you install the heater must have enough ventilation. The National Fuel Gas Codes do not allow NON-DIRECT VENT gas fired water heater installations in bathrooms, bedrooms or any occupied rooms normally kept closed. See chapter 4.6 (page 18). \\n\\n4. You must correctly vent your heater. See chapter 4.6 (page 18) on VENTING. 5. The appliance and its gas connection must be leak tested before placing the appliance in operation. The appliance must be isolated from the gas supply piping system by \\n\\nclosing its individual manual gas shutoff valve (not supplied with heater) during any pressure testing at pressures in excess of $\\\\%$ Psig (3.5 kPa). \\n\\n6. Keep the water heater area clear and free from combustibles and flammable liquids. Do not locate the heater over any material which might burn. \\n\\n7. Correct gas pressure is critical for the proper operation of this heater. Gas piping must be sized to provide the required pressure at the maximum output of the heater, while all the other gas appliances are in operation. Check with your local gas supplier, and see the section on connecting the gas supply. See chapter 4.8 (page 33). \\n\\n8. Should overheating occur or the gas supply fail to shut off, turn off the gas supply at the manual gas shut off valve, on the gas line. Note: manual gas shutoff valve is not supplied with the heater but must be field installed. \\n\\n9. Do not use this appliance if any part has been underwater. Immediately call the responsible party for the installation of your appliance to inspect the appliance and to replace any part of the water heater which has been underwater. \\n\\n10.Failure to install the heater correctly may lead to unsafe operation. \\n\\n▶ Improper operation.   \\n▶ Loss of warranty. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\n▶ The water heater must be installed by a Locally Licensed Professional in accordance with these instructions. If improperly installed, a hazardous condition such as explosion or carbon monoxide poisoning could result. Bosch Thermotechnology Corp. is not responsible for improperly installed appliances. \\n\\nCommon installation practice is to first determine the path and method of venting, then design the piping layout. \\n\\n4.3 Proper location for installing your heater \\n\\nCarefully select the location of the water heater. For your safety and for proper heater operation, you must provide combustion air to the heater and properly vent the exhaust gases. Follow the guidelines below: \\n\\n▶ 1. Locate the heater where venting, gas and plumbing connections are feasible and convenient. $\\\\blacktriangleright$ 2. The hot water lines should be kept short and insulated to save energy. It is recommended to locate the water heater as close as practical\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Natural

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nfor installing your heater \\n\\nCarefully select the location of the water heater. For your safety and for proper heater operation, you must provide combustion air to the heater and properly vent the exhaust gases. Follow the guidelines below: \\n\\n▶ 1. Locate the heater where venting, gas and plumbing connections are feasible and convenient. $\\\\blacktriangleright$ 2. The hot water lines should be kept short and insulated to save energy. It is recommended to locate the water heater as close as practical to the most frequently used hot water fixtures. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nFor servicing access, a 2ft clearance is recommended to the front cover. \\n\\nRisk of appliance freezing! \\n\\n▶ The water in this water heater is cold and always remains cold except for the times the burner is on. In the event of power outage in conjunction with freezing temperatures, the heater should be drained. See chapter 7.2, page 59 “Winterizing” for draining instructions. \\n\\n4 Installation instructions \\n\\n4.1 Installation tools \\n\\nThe following specialized tools may be required if converting from natural gas to LP: \\n\\n• Pressure manometer \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nInstallation \\n\\nDo not install the water heater in rooms with a high moisture level (e.g. bathrooms, saunas). \\n\\n4.2 Introduction \\n\\nPlease follow these instructions. Failure to follow instructions may result in: \\n\\n▶ Damage or injury. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\n▶ Flammable materials, gasoline, pressurized containers, or any other items or articles that are potential fire hazards must NOT be placed on or adjacent to the heater. The appliance area must be kept free of all combustible materials, gasoline and other flammable vapors and liquids. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\nRisk of blockage! \\n\\n▶ Excess of solid particles (e.g. bugs, pollen) in the air intake may clog the air filter and lead to premature failure of the heater if not protected accordingly.   \\nDo not install the water heater in areas where excess of solid particles may accumulate. \\n\\n4.4 Heater placement and clearances \\n\\nThe water heater design is approved for installation on a combustible wall (see chapter 4.5 Mounting installation) provided the floor covering below the heater is noncombustible. \\n\\nFor installations in an alcove or closet, maintain the minimum clearances to combustible and non-combustible materials. See fig. 6, page 16. \\n\\n4.5 Hanging appliance on the wall \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\nSevere personal injury and property damage! \\n\\nBefore mounting appliance: \\n\\n▶ Check that there are no loose or damaged parts inside the appliance.   \\n▶ Set the heater gas type according to the gas supplied to the unit.   \\nConfirm that the water heater has been properly setup for the gas type supplied to the unit. See conversion instructions in section 6.8.1 as needed. \\n\\nFront cover should be removed (see instructions on page 12) in order to inspect components visually. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\n▶ Do not install this appliance on a carpeted wall. The heater must be mounted on a wall using appropriate anchoring materials. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nRisk of appliance freezing! \\n\\n▶ In areas where outside temperature is routinely below $3 2 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { F }$ $( 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ and the heater is to be installed on the inside of an exterior wall, provide a minimum $2 \\\"$ air gap or rigid insulation between the heater back and the wall. \\n\\nIf the wall is sheathed with plaster or drywall, it is recommended that two support boards, either 1\\\"x 4\\\" or $1 / 2 \\\"$ (minimum) plywood first be attached across a pair of studs, see fig. 7. \\n\\n▶ Secure the wall mounting bracket provided with the heater to a wall surface. The heater must be kept level on the wall surface, see fig. 8, page 18.   \\n▶ Hang the appliance on the bracket, see fig. 9, page 18. \\n\\nCAUTION: \\n\\nPersonal injury and property damage. \\n\\nAppliance must be installed vertically. \\n\\n4.6 Venting \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nFlue gas poisoning! \\n\\n▶ Do not reduce the exhaust or combustion air vent pipe sizes.   \\n▶ Do not common vent with any other vented appliance or stove.   \\n▶ Do not use Type-B vent as the actual exhaust vent system for the appliance. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nFlue gas poisoning! \\n\\n▶ Failure to vent the exhaust gases to the outside (see table 5 for proper material) may result in dangerous flue gases filling the structure in which it is installed. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\n▶ Installations resulting in negative pressure/back draft require sealed combustion (twin pipe / concentric). Damage caused from back draft, ie. freezing, are not covered by warranty. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nAppliance malfunction! \\n\\n▶ Protect the inlet air supply from leaves and debris by installing a screen on the intake of the termination. A minimum screen mesh size of $1 / 4 ^ { 1 1 }$ is recommended.   \\n▶ Do not install the water heater in areas where dust and chemicals like hair sprays, spray detergents, chlorine, may accumulate. \\n\\nDo not cover non-metallic vent pipe and fittings with thermal insulation, unless going through an insulated wall or ceiling. \\n\\nFlue temperature: \\n\\n▶ To prevent the risk of flue material overheat the appliance's flue temperature is sensed and is limited. The flue temperature limit is dependent on inlet water temperature. ▶ Residential models: Maximum flue temperature is limited to 145 °F $( 6 3 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ . \\n\\n4.6.1 Vent options \\n\\nThis appliance can be installed as direct vent or Category IV.

Single Pipe Venting \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ Single pipe venting not recommended in cold climates. Installations resulting in negative pressure/back draft require sealed combustion (twin pipe / concentric).Damage caused from back draft, ie. freezing, are not covered by warranty. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ When installed in an environment where corrosive chemicals or dirty air (e.g. hair salons, car washes) are present the sealed combustion (twin pipe or concentric) is required. \n\nAir combustion \n\nDANGER: \n\nThe lack of adequate air openings may lead to improper operation due to other appliances consuming required air. \n\n▶ Always follow local codes and regulations of authority having jurisdiction in case of single pipe installation in confined spaces. \n\nAlthough it is permissible to draw the air-intake from the inside, it is not the manufacturer’s recommended installation method. Install a $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ elbow or air intake screen on the top of the airintake inlet adaptor to prevent foreign objects from falling into the unit. \n\nIf a single pipe installation is utilized, follow guidelines below for providing adequate combustion air for the water heater as well as any other appliances that may consume air in the same space. Always follow local codes and regulations of the authority having jurisdiction. \n\n• Appliances located in unconfined spaces: \n\n– a) An unconfined space is one whose volume is greater than 50 cubic feet (1.42 cubic meter) per 1000 BTU/ hr (292.81 Watts) of the combined rating of all appliances installed in the space. That would be 9950 cubic feet (281.8 cubic meters) or 1243 square feet with 8 foot ceiling, for a single 199 kBTU water heater. b) In unconfined spaces in buildings of conventional frame, masonry, or metal construction, infiltration air is normally adequate to provide air for combustion. \n\n• Appliances located in confined spaces: \n\nThe confined space must be provided with two permanent openings, one commencing within 12 inches $( 3 0 4 . 8 \\mathsf { m m } )$ of the top and one commencing within 12 inches $( 3 0 4 . 8 \\mathsf { m m } )$ of the bottom of the enclosure. Each opening must have a minimum free area of one square inch per: \n\n– 1000 BTU/hr (292.81 Watts) if all air is taken from inside the building 2000 BTU/hr (585.62 Watts) if all air is taken from the outside by horizontal ducts 4000 BTU/hr (1171.24 Watts) if all air is taken from the outside by direct openings or vertical ducts \n\nOr the confined space must be provided with one permanent opening or duct that is within 12 inches $( 3 0 4 . 8 \\mathsf { m m } )$ of the ceiling of the enclosure. This opening must have a minimum free area of one square inch per: \n\n– 3000 BTU/hr (878.43 Watts) if all air is taken from the outside by a direct opening or vertical duct. \n\nLouvers, grills and screens have a blocking effect, when used, increase the sizes of your openings by $300 \\%$ for wood louvers (as wood type will reduce the free air by $7 5 \\%$ ) and $4 3 \\%$ for metal louvers (as metal will reduce the free air by $3 0 \\%$ ).

Measure the length of the gas supply line from the building's gas main to the heater and use the chapter 4.8.1 and 4.8.2 or the gas line manufacturer’s sizing tables to determine the pipe diameter necessary. If there are more gas appliances on the line, size the gas line according to the total maximum amount of BTU draw input rating of all appliances combined. \n\nNote: Undersizing the gas line may result in diminished hot water flow rate and temperature, or improper appliance operation (noise and combustion instabilities). See chapter 4.13, page 44 for the procedure to measure gas pressure. Proper gas pressure must be confirmed at time of installation. \n\n4.8.1 Gas Line Sizing Tables for NATURAL GAS \n\nFor your convenience, see below an excerpt from gas line sizing tables for a single NG appliance. For details, see the current NFPA 54. \n\nRequired input for 160000 / 199000 BTU/hr for the Greentherm T9900 SE/i. The gas supply system must be sized for the combined total maximum BTU/hr load requirements of all gas appliances running simultaneously. \n\nThe tables below show the maximum capacity of the gas supply pipe in cubic feet per hour. Please contact your local gas supplier for the energy content of the gas to determine the BTU/hr capacity. Use 1,000 BTU/cubic foot for rough estimations. \n\n\\* EHD $=$ Equivalent Hydraulic Diameter. The greater the value of EHD, the greater the gas capacity of the tubing. \n\n4.8.2 Gas Line Sizing Tables for LP GAS \n\nFor your convenience, see below an excerpt from gas line sizing tables for a single LP appliance. Their intended use is for pipe sizing between the 2nd stage (low pressure) regulator and the appliance.

The flue temperature limit is dependent on inlet water temperature. ▶ Residential models: Maximum flue temperature is limited to 145 °F $( 6 3 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ . \\n\\n4.6.1 Vent options \\n\\nThis appliance can be installed as direct vent or Category IV. The Greentherm T9900 SE/i is approved with the following venting options: \\n\\nFor specific questions concerning vent material, specifications, usage or installation, please contact the vent manufacturer directly. \\n\\nApproved Vent Manufacturers; \\n\\nM&G   \\nCentrotherm   \\nIPEX   \\nRoyal Plastics   \\nEccovent   \\nCharlotte   \\nZ-Flex \\n\\nDo not use cellular foam core pipe for exhaust.This material is approved for intake only. \\n\\nThe vent connection for the appliance is secured with a clamp on the appliance exhaust adapter. All other vent connections must be glued, except PP and flex PP. Slide the vent pipe into the exhaust adapter. The exhaust pipe must be properly supported and must be pitched a minimum of $\\\\mathtt { a } \\\\%$ inch per foot back to the appliance. This allows the condensate to drain properly. \\n\\nMaximum vent lengths and equivalent lengths per table 8 apply. \\n\\n4.6.3 Vent specifications \\n\\nCAUTION: \\n\\nRisk of CO poisoning! \\n\\nAn improperly sized venting system may lead to undesired effects such as the formation of condensate, gas leakage or spillage. \\n\\nEstablish vent clearances that comply with the vent manufacturer's specifications and all applicable national/local codes. \\n\\nMinimum combustion air and exhaust pipe length \\n\\nThe minimum exhaust pipe length is 1 foot $\\\\left( 0 . 3 m \\\\right)$ of straight vent pipe. The minimum combustion air pipe length is one 1 ft pipe or one $9 0 ^ { \\\\circ }$ elbow with an air intake grill cap to prevent debris from falling into the appliance. \\n\\nMaximum combustion air and exhaust pipe length \\n\\nThe table 8 displays the maximum allowable straight pipe lengths for air intake and exhaust piping.

Vent should terminate at least 3 feet $( 9 1 5 \\\\mathsf { m m } )$ ) away from adjacent walls, inside corners and 5 feet $1 5 2 5 \\\\mathsf { m m }$ below roof overhang. \\n\\nImproper gas pressure or vent length may result in undesired symptoms or errors such as noisy burner, C1, C2, CF, EA, EC. \\n\\nThe vent for this appliance shall not terminate: \\n\\n1. over public walkways; or   \\n2. near soffit vents or crawl space vents or other areas where condensate or vapor could create a nuisance or hazard or cause papery damage; or   \\n3. where condensate vapor could cause damage or could

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nODES and/or local installation codes. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nExplosion hazard! \\n\\n▶ DO NOT connect to an unregulated or high pressure propane line or to a high pressure commercial natural gas line. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nExplosion hazard! \\n\\n▶ The heater must be isolated from the gas supply piping system during any pressure testing of that system at test pressures equal to or more than 0.5 psig. If overpressure has occurred, such as through improper testing of the gas lines or malfunction of the supply system, the gas valve must be checked for safe operation. \\n\\nGAS CONNECTIONS \\n\\n▶ Install a manual gas shut off valve on the gas supply line within easy reach of the appliance.   \\n▶ Install a union when connecting the gas supply.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Gas connection to the water heater is ¾\\\" NPT. See chapter 4.8.1 for the minimum internal pipe diameter required.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Undersized flexible appliance connector is not permitted.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ National Fuel Gas Code requires that a sediment trap (drip leg) be installed on gas appliances not so equipped. The drip leg must be accessible and not subject to freezing conditions. Install in accordance with the recommendations of the serving gas supplier, see fig. 25.   \\n▶ Tighten gas pipe with the support of a wrench, see fig. 24.   \\n[1] Shut off valve   \\n[2] Gas supply   \\n[3] Cap   \\n[LA] Minimum 3\\\" sediment trap, (drip leg) \\n\\nOnce connections are made, check for gas leaks at all joints. Apply some gas leak detection solution to all gas fittings. Bubbles are a sign of a leak. A combustible gas detector may also be used to detect for leaks. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nExplosion hazard! \\n\\n▶ If you detect a gas leak, shut off the gas and ventilate the room (open windows, doors). Tighten appropriate fittings to stop leak. Turn the gas on and check again with a gas leak detection solution. Never test for gas leaks using a match or flame. \\n\\nGAS LINE SIZING \\n\\nThe gas supply piping for a single heater should be sized for a maximum draw of 199000 BTU/hr for Greentherm T9900 SE/i. Measure the length of the gas supply line from the building's gas main to the heater and use the chapter 4.8.1 and 4.8.2 or the gas line manufacturer’s sizing tables to determine the pipe diameter necessary. If there are more gas appliances on the line, size the gas line according to the total maximum amount of BTU draw input rating of all appliances combined. \\n\\nNote: Undersizing the gas line may result in diminished hot water flow rate and temperature, or improper appliance operation (noise and combustion instabilities). See chapter 4.13, page 44 for the procedure to measure gas pressure. Proper gas pressure must be confirmed at time of installation. \\n\\n4.8.1 Gas Line Sizing Tables for NATURAL GAS \\n\\nFor your convenience, see below an excerpt from gas line sizing tables for a single NG appliance. For details, see the current NFPA 54. \\n\\nRequired input for 160000 / 199000 BTU/hr for the Greentherm T9900 SE/i. The gas supply system must be sized for the combined total maximum BTU/hr load requirements of all gas appliances running simultaneously. \\n\\nThe tables below show the maximum capacity of the gas supply pipe in cubic feet per hour. Please contact your local gas supplier for the energy content of the gas to determine the BTU/hr capacity. Use 1,000 BTU/cubic foot for rough estimations. \\n\\n\\\\* EHD $=$ Equivalent Hydraulic Diameter. The greater the value of EHD, the greater the gas capacity of the tubing. \\n\\n4.8.2 Gas Line Sizing Tables for LP GAS \\n\\nFor your convenience, see below an excerpt from gas line sizing tables for a single LP appliance. Their intended use is for pipe sizing between the 2nd stage (low pressure) regulator and the appliance. For details, see the current NFPA 54 or NFPA 58. \\n\\nRequired input for 160000 / 199000 BTU/hr for the Greentherm T9900 SE/i. The gas supply system must be sized for the combined total maximum BTU/hr load requirements of all gas appliances running simultaneously. \\n\\n$\\\\star _ { \\\\sf E H D } =$ Equivalent Hydraulic Diameter. The greater the value of EHD, the greater the gas capacity of the tubing. \\n\\n\\\\* Source National Fuel Gas Code NFPA 54, ANSI Z223.1 - No Additional Allowance is necessary for an ordinary number of fittings. \\n\\n4.9 Water quality \\n\\nWater quality can have an impact on appliance longevity. Water supplied to the Greentherm T9900 SE/i must be in accordance with table 17 and fig. 26. \\n\\nFor water analysis data call your local water department, or if on a well, have well water analyzed periodically. Heavy scale will form if the combination of water total hardness and pH exceeds the values specified in fig. 26 (grey area), Bosch recommends consulting a local water treatment professional for water softening/conditioning options. \\n\\n1. Total Harness and pH maximum values must be evaluated in combination. Indicated maximum values will be reduced according to fig. 26.   \\n2. Combined values of total hardness and pH must be under the indicated grey area. (e.g. the pair [180;8.3] [total hardness; pH] is not acceptable). \\n\\nConnecting the pressure relief valve (PRV) \\n\\nA pressure relief valve is included in the box and must be installed at the time of installation.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

The scheduling option is not available for tank loading. \n\n• External NTC - 7 736 504 583 \n\nOnly compatible with Bosch cable/sensor accessory (7736504583). Sensor must be inserted into the tank pocket and plug in at the tank connector in bottom of the appliance. \n\n• Aquastat - - 7 736 504 584 – Compatible with thermostat type solution (example Aquastat). Thermostat/Aquastat must be connected to the appliance using the tank connector in bottom of the appliance. \n\n• Internal NTC \n\n– Allows tank loading without using any external sensor/ cable. Temperature readings will be made at the appliance. \n\nFor more information how to program each menu, see chapter 6.5.2, page 49. \n\nPump performance curve, shown in Fig. 32, is an extra information for Locally Licensed Professional. \n\n4.12 Space heating applications \n\nDANGER: \n\nRisk of scalding! \n\n▶ If the set point temperature is above $1 2 0 \\%$ $( 4 9 ^ { \\circ } \\mathsf { C } )$ , precautions should be taken to protect users of potable water from scalding. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ The use of a flow switch is recommended to ensure DHW priority and to prevent “cold-blow” situations when the Bosch tankless water heater is used with an air handler. Air handler installation must include a pump. The flow switch should be used to disable the blower on the air-handling system when domestic water is used. \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ Ensure the primary pump is properly sized to provide adequate flow for the system heat load. \n\nFor external pump sizing please refer to the pressure drop curves, fig. 34. Also remember to account for system piping pressure loss. A minimum of 1.7 GPM is recommended to provide adequate flow through the water heater when determining the size of the primary pump. \n\nGreentherm T9900 SE/i tankless water heaters are approved for use in combination DHW and space heating applications (open loop setup). \n\nThese water heaters are not approved for use in space heating only applications (closed-loop setup). Bosch supports applications of combination DHW and space heating in an open loop configuration if plumbed in compliance with Fig. 33. Please see warranty document for additional details. \n\nApplications of combined DHW and space heating in an open loop configuration, when combined with recirculation are not recommended and desired performance is not guaranteed. These applications will require special configurations to ensure proper interaction between the different sub-systems (e.g. Air Handler, Mixing valve, etc.). \n\n4.13 Measuring gas pressure \n\n4.13.1 Gas supply pressure \n\nConfirm gas pressure upon installation. \n\nConnecting manometer \n\n▶ Shut off gas supply at installer supplied shutoff valve for this water heater.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Locate the inlet gas pressure test port (see Fig. 35).   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Loosen the screw inside test port fitting (do not remove) and connect the manometer tube to the test port (see Fig. 35). \n\nStatic Pressure Test \n\n▶ Turn the gas supply back on.   \n▶ Record the static gas pressure reading in table 21. \n\nDynamic Pressure Test \n\n▶ Turn ON the appliance.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Access menu P1 Max. Power, see section 6.6. \n\nNote: While in this mode the appliance will run constantly at maximum power and allow maximum water flow. \n\nFor inlet gas pressure adjustment consider the following table: \n\n1) To assure maximum heat input at maximum vent length, the minimum gas pressure should be 5\" W.C. for the 199 kBTU models and $4 \" W . C$ . for the 160 kBTU models. For more information see section 4.6.3. \n\nTable 20 Minimum inlet gas pressure under full operation \n\n▶ Operate all other gas appliances (except heater) on the same gas piping system at maximum output.   \nOpen all hot water faucets to achieve a flow rate of at least 6 gallons per minute. (1 tub and 2 sinks should be sufficient). If heater goes back to P2, open more hot water fixtures to allow sufficient flow to keep the water heater in P1.   \n▶ Record the lowest operating gas pressure reading in table 21.   \n▶ Turn OFF the appliance.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Shut off gas supply.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Disconnect the manometer tube from the test point.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Tighten the screw inside test point fitting. \n\nDepending on the vent length, gas pressures below 5\" W.C. for Natural Gas or 8\" W.C. for LPG may result in reduced power output or possible error codes and must be corrected.

Indicated maximum values will be reduced according to fig. 26.   \\n2. Combined values of total hardness and pH must be under the indicated grey area. (e.g. the pair [180;8.3] [total hardness; pH] is not acceptable). \\n\\nConnecting the pressure relief valve (PRV) \\n\\nA pressure relief valve is included in the box and must be installed at the time of installation. No valve is to be placed between the PRV and the heater. No reducing coupling or other restriction may be installed in the discharge line. The discharge line must be a minimum of 4” above a drain and installed such that it allows complete drainage of both the PRV and the line. The discharge line must be placed where it will not cause any damage. \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Use the integrated port to install the PRV, see Fig. 27 [1].   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Tighten the PRV with the support of a wrench, see Fig. 27.   \\n▶ Support all piping. \\n\\n4.10 Water connections \\n\\nWater connections are on top ONLY.   \\nBottom connections are drain/service ports with limited flow capacity. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nThis heater is not approved for preheated water applications exceeding $1 4 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { F }$ $( 6 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ for Residential appliances, in these cases use a 3-way valve or mixing valve must be installed before the appliance to prevent water exceeding $1 4 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { F }$ $( 6 0 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ for Residential appliances from entering the appliance. \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ When facing the heater, the ¾\\\" cold connection is on the top right and the hot connection is on the top left.   \\nTighten all water connections with the support of a wrench, see Fig. 28. \\n\\n[1] Cold connection [2] Hot connection [1] Cap [2] Water filter \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nAppliance damage! \\n\\nAppliance will overheat if not filled with water. \\n\\n▶ Ensure that the appliance is filled with water by opening a hot water faucet, before plug in the water heater to the power supply. \\n\\n▶ The use of unions when connecting to the inlet and outlet connections is recommended. This will facilitate any necessary servicing.   \\n▶ Plastic or PEX type plumbing materials are not suitable for connecting directly to or within $1 8 \\\"$ of the water heater.   \\n▶ Although water piping throughout the building may not be copper, we require that copper or suitably rated stainless steel flex line be used for the water connections for $1 8 \\\"$ on either side of the water heater (follow local codes if more stringent).   \\n▶ Never sweat any piping directly to water connections, as damage will occur.   \\n▶ Keep water inlet and outlet pipes to no less than ¾\\\" diameter to allow the full flow capacity.   \\nIf the cold and hot connections to the heater are reversed, the heater will not function.   \\n▶ Be certain there are no loose particles or dirt in the piping. Blow out or flush the lines before connecting to the water heater.   \\n▶ Full port shutoff valves should be installed on both the cold water supply and hot water outlet lines to facilitate servicing the heater (see fig. 27).   \\nFor installation on a private well system with a pressure tank, the lowest pressure range setting recommended is 30-45 psi (2.06 - 3.1bar) to ensure optimal performance. \\n\\n4.11 Domestic hot water recirculation \\n\\nThe following drawings are provided to illustrate two possible recirculation designs. These schematic is for illustration only and must not be used for actual Installation without appropriate engineering and technical advice from a properly licensed professional in the locality where the installation is made. \\n\\nIn order to reduce the heat loss through the pipes, it’s recommended to insulate all the pipes in the recirculation circuit. \\n\\n4.11.1 Start up procedure \\n\\nAppliance damage! \\n\\n▶ Ensure that the water circuit is fill before activate recirculation mode. \\n\\n▶ Open a hot water faucet to fill the water circuit.   \\n▶ Open the purge valve in the recirculation circuit (dedicated mode) near the appliance water inlet.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Turn on the appliance.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Set the recirculation mode in HMI.

damper in unconditioned spaces (e.g. attics) Condensation can build up while the heater is running which can later freeze and potentially block the flapper. \\n\\n[1] Good [2] Better [3] Best \\n\\n4.6.7 Single Pipe Venting \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\n▶ Single pipe venting not recommended in cold climates. Installations resulting in negative pressure/back draft require sealed combustion (twin pipe / concentric).Damage caused from back draft, ie. freezing, are not covered by warranty. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\n▶ When installed in an environment where corrosive chemicals or dirty air (e.g. hair salons, car washes) are present the sealed combustion (twin pipe or concentric) is required. \\n\\nAir combustion \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nThe lack of adequate air openings may lead to improper operation due to other appliances consuming required air. \\n\\n▶ Always follow local codes and regulations of authority having jurisdiction in case of single pipe installation in confined spaces. \\n\\nAlthough it is permissible to draw the air-intake from the inside, it is not the manufacturer’s recommended installation method. Install a $9 0 ^ { \\\\circ }$ elbow or air intake screen on the top of the airintake inlet adaptor to prevent foreign objects from falling into the unit. \\n\\nIf a single pipe installation is utilized, follow guidelines below for providing adequate combustion air for the water heater as well as any other appliances that may consume air in the same space. Always follow local codes and regulations of the authority having jurisdiction. \\n\\n• Appliances located in unconfined spaces: \\n\\n– a) An unconfined space is one whose volume is greater than 50 cubic feet (1.42 cubic meter) per 1000 BTU/ hr (292.81 Watts) of the combined rating of all appliances installed in the space. That would be 9950 cubic feet (281.8 cubic meters) or 1243 square feet with 8 foot ceiling, for a single 199 kBTU water heater. b) In unconfined spaces in buildings of conventional frame, masonry, or metal construction, infiltration air is normally adequate to provide air for combustion. \\n\\n• Appliances located in confined spaces: \\n\\nThe confined space must be provided with two permanent openings, one commencing within 12 inches $( 3 0 4 . 8 \\\\mathsf { m m } )$ of the top and one commencing within 12 inches $( 3 0 4 . 8 \\\\mathsf { m m } )$ of the bottom of the enclosure. Each opening must have a minimum free area of one square inch per: \\n\\n– 1000 BTU/hr (292.81 Watts) if all air is taken from inside the building 2000 BTU/hr (585.62 Watts) if all air is taken from the outside by horizontal ducts 4000 BTU/hr (1171.24 Watts) if all air is taken from the outside by direct openings or vertical ducts \\n\\nOr the confined space must be provided with one permanent opening or duct that is within 12 inches $( 3 0 4 . 8 \\\\mathsf { m m } )$ of the ceiling of the enclosure. This opening must have a minimum free area of one square inch per: \\n\\n– 3000 BTU/hr (878.43 Watts) if all air is taken from the outside by a direct opening or vertical duct. \\n\\nLouvers, grills and screens have a blocking effect, when used, increase the sizes of your openings by $300 \\\\%$ for wood louvers (as wood type will reduce the free air by $7 5 \\\\%$ ) and $4 3 \\\\%$ for metal louvers (as metal will reduce the free air by $3 0 \\\\%$ ).

For any other adjustments see chapter 8.12. \\n\\n4.7.1 Natural gas \\n\\nThe appliances must not be operated if the dynamic gas pressure is less than $3 . 5 ^ { \\\\stackrel {  } { \\\\mathrm { W C } ^ { 1 } } ) }$ or greater than 10.5” WC. \\n\\n4.7.2 Liquid propane gas (after gas conversion) \\n\\nThe appliances must not be operated if the dynamic gas pressure is less than 8”WC or greater than 13” WC. \\n\\nIf gas conversion is needed (Natural Gas to Liquid propane gas), see section 6.8. \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\n▶ The gas type conversion must only be carried out by a Locally Licensed Professional, see chapter 6.8.1 Gas conversion. \\n\\n4.8 Gas piping & connections \\n\\nBefore connecting the gas supply, be sure that the heater is set for the same gas to which it will be connected. In the United States: The installation must conform with local codes or, in the absence of local codes, the National Fuel Gas Code ANSI Z223.1/NFPA 54. In Canada: The Installation must conform to CGA B149 INSTALLATION CODES and/or local installation codes. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nExplosion hazard! \\n\\n▶ DO NOT connect to an unregulated or high pressure propane line or to a high pressure commercial natural gas line. \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nExplosion hazard! \\n\\n▶ The heater must be isolated from the gas supply piping system during any pressure testing of that system at test pressures equal to or more than 0.5 psig.

temperature sensors to control the recirculation option. The scheduling option is not available for tank loading. \\n\\n• External NTC - 7 736 504 583 \\n\\nOnly compatible with Bosch cable/sensor accessory (7736504583). Sensor must be inserted into the tank pocket and plug in at the tank connector in bottom of the appliance. \\n\\n• Aquastat - - 7 736 504 584 – Compatible with thermostat type solution (example Aquastat). Thermostat/Aquastat must be connected to the appliance using the tank connector in bottom of the appliance. \\n\\n• Internal NTC \\n\\n– Allows tank loading without using any external sensor/ cable. Temperature readings will be made at the appliance. \\n\\nFor more information how to program each menu, see chapter 6.5.2, page 49. \\n\\nPump performance curve, shown in Fig. 32, is an extra information for Locally Licensed Professional. \\n\\n4.12 Space heating applications \\n\\nDANGER: \\n\\nRisk of scalding! \\n\\n▶ If the set point temperature is above $1 2 0 \\\\%$ $( 4 9 ^ { \\\\circ } \\\\mathsf { C } )$ , precautions should be taken to protect users of potable water from scalding. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\n▶ The use of a flow switch is recommended to ensure DHW priority and to prevent “cold-blow” situations when the Bosch tankless water heater is used with an air handler. Air handler installation must include a pump. The flow switch should be used to disable the blower on the air-handling system when domestic water is used. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\n▶ Ensure the primary pump is properly sized to provide adequate flow for the system heat load. \\n\\nFor external pump sizing please refer to the pressure drop curves, fig. 34. Also remember to account for system piping pressure loss. A minimum of 1.7 GPM is recommended to provide adequate flow through the water heater when determining the size of the primary pump. \\n\\nGreentherm T9900 SE/i tankless water heaters are approved for use in combination DHW and space heating applications (open loop setup). \\n\\nThese water heaters are not approved for use in space heating only applications (closed-loop setup). Bosch supports applications of combination DHW and space heating in an open loop configuration if plumbed in compliance with Fig. 33. Please see warranty document for additional details. \\n\\nApplications of combined DHW and space heating in an open loop configuration, when combined with recirculation are not recommended and desired performance is not guaranteed. These applications will require special configurations to ensure proper interaction between the different sub-systems (e.g. Air Handler, Mixing valve, etc.). \\n\\n4.13 Measuring gas pressure \\n\\n4.13.1 Gas supply pressure \\n\\nConfirm gas pressure upon installation. \\n\\nConnecting manometer \\n\\n▶ Shut off gas supply at installer supplied shutoff valve for this water heater.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Locate the inlet gas pressure test port (see Fig. 35).   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Loosen the screw inside test port fitting (do not remove) and connect the manometer tube to the test port (see Fig. 35). \\n\\nStatic Pressure Test \\n\\n▶ Turn the gas supply back on.   \\n▶ Record the static gas pressure reading in table 21. \\n\\nDynamic Pressure Test \\n\\n▶ Turn ON the appliance.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Access menu P1 Max. Power, see section 6.6. \\n\\nNote: While in this mode the appliance will run constantly at maximum power and allow maximum water flow. \\n\\nFor inlet gas pressure adjustment consider the following table: \\n\\n1) To assure maximum heat input at maximum vent length, the minimum gas pressure should be 5\\\" W.C. for the 199 kBTU models and $4 \\\" W . C$ . for the 160 kBTU models. For more information see section 4.6.3. \\n\\nTable 20 Minimum inlet gas pressure under full operation \\n\\n▶ Operate all other gas appliances (except heater) on the same gas piping system at maximum output.   \\nOpen all hot water faucets to achieve a flow rate of at least 6 gallons per minute. (1 tub and 2 sinks should be sufficient). If heater goes back to P2, open more hot water fixtures to allow sufficient flow to keep the water heater in P1.   \\n▶ Record the lowest operating gas pressure reading in table 21.   \\n▶ Turn OFF the appliance.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Shut off gas supply.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Disconnect the manometer tube from the test point.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Tighten the screw inside test point fitting. \\n\\nDepending on the vent length, gas pressures below 5\\\" W.C. for Natural Gas or 8\\\" W.C. for LPG may result in reduced power output or possible error codes and must be corrected.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

Immediately repair all faults to avoid damage to the system.   \n1) Proceed with air filter cleaning or replacement if error code CE, CF and C2 is displayed. Check the flue exhaust for blockage (appliance is protected against flue blockage).   \n2) Proceed with heat exchanger descaling whenever error codes AA and E5 are displayed (appliance is protected against over heating in case of scaling), see table 17 Water Quality. \n\nTable 24 Annual maintenance \n\n7.1 Required annual maintenance \n\n(To remove front cover, see page 12) \n\nWARNING: \n\nMaintenance must be done by a Locally Licensed Professional. \n\nVenting System \n\nNOTICE: \n\n▶ For horizontally vented appliances, keep the area around the venting system free of snow or ice to prevent blockage. \n\nVenting system blocked! \n\n• Venting system - Inspect inside of flue pipe and remove any blockage or restriction. Observe burner flames during heater operation (front cover must be removed). Burner flames should be steady and blue. Yellow, inconsistent (bouncing) flames may be an indication of poor ventilation or combustion air supply. Inspect the combustion air intake pipe and remove any blockage or debris. Inspect air intake and exhaust terminations and remove any blockage or debris. \n\nHeat Exchanger \n\n• Inspect burner observation window for cracks or spillage of flue gases. Observe burner flames during heater operation. Flames should be steady and blue with no signs of yellowing. Yellow burner flames are an indication of improper combustion. Refer to section 4.6 to verify the exhaust system and combustion air supply meets the manufacturer's specifications. \n\nPressure Relief \n\n• Manually open the pressure relief valve to ensure proper operation, make sure discharge drains away safely. \n\nInlet Water Filter \n\n• Verify the inlet water filter screen is clean and undamaged. The inlet water filter is located on the top of the appliance, at the cold water inlet connection. (See Fig. 29, page 38). Close the installer supplied water shutoff valve purge the water using discharge drains and remove the brass hex cap holding filter.

Air filter must be cleaned or replaced in case it is clogged or damaged. \n\nHow to remove/assembly air filter \n\n▶ Disconnect the electrical supply from the water heater.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Remove appliance front cover, see page 12.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Remove cover from the air filter.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Loosen two philips head screws.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Remove air filter from the fan.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Clean filter with soft toothbrush, do not use water or compressed air.   \n▶ Proceed in the reverse order for assembly. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nAppliance malfunction! \n\nAir filter should not be removed during appliance normal operation as, as it may increase the risk of burner blockage. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nRisk of burner blockage! \n\n▶ Paper filter (part # 8738725270) installed on the air fan for increased protection against dusty, dirty combustion air or heavy pollen entering the combustion chamber to reduce the risk of burner blockage. Maintenance frequency might need to be adjusted to keep the filter clean and allow a good performance of the heater. \n\n7.2 Winterizing for seasonal use \n\nThe water heater must not be installed in a location where it may be exposed to freezing temperatures unless connected to electrical power. All water must be drained from the heater in order to avoid damage to the unit from exposure to freezing temperatures. \n\nNOTICE: \n\nUse of agents such as anti-freeze is not permitted and voids the warranty, as they may cause damage to the water heater's internal components. \n\n1. Hold ON/OFF switch on the water heater for 3 secs. to turn OFF the heater and unplug the power supply cord. The display should be blank.   \n2. Shut off the gas supply to the water heater.   \n3. Shut off the water supply to the water heater using installer supplied shutoff valve.   \n4. Open hot water faucets to drain and relieve pressure from the plumbing system. If water continues to flow after 5 minutes, a crossover of the hot and cold water pipes is present and must be corrected before proceeding.   \n5. Disconnect the inlet and outlet water pipes from the water heater. Place a small bucket underneath the water heater to catch residual water remaining inside the water heater.   \n6. Using an air compressor, blow short bursts of air (50psi max) through the inlet water connection or inlet water filter until there is no water present coming through the outlet water connection of the heater.   \n7. Empty condensate trap.   \n8. Reconnect the water fittings and return the heater to service when danger of freezing has passed. \n\n7.3 Mineral scale build-up \n\nPeriodic descaling may be necessary in areas with high mineral content in the water (See table 17 Water Quality). Scale buildup in the heat exchanger may result in lower flow rates, error codes of AA, E3, A5 and boiling sounds in the heat exchanger. \n\nA water softener is required if the water hardness exceeds 12 grains/gal $( 2 0 0 \\mathsf { m g } / | )$ calcium carbonate. Damage to the water heater resulting from hard water/scale deposits will not be covered under warranty. \n\nDescaling using a pump \n\n$\\blacktriangleright$ Disconnect the electrical supply from the water heater.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Shut off the water supply to the water heater.   \n$\\blacktriangleright$ Open hot water faucets to drain and relieve pressure from the plumbing system. Shut off hot water valve to the water heater. Remove the caps from both inlet and outlet drain connections. Connect a line (A) from the outlet of the circulating pump (installer supplied) to the inlet drain connection on the water heater (see fig. 55.)   \n▶ Using another line (B), connect the outlet drain connection on the water heater. Route the other end of this line into a descaling reservoir.   \n▶ Using a 3rd line (C) from the descaling reservoir, connect to the inlet side of circulating pump. Install a filter on the end of the line in the descaling reservoir.   \n▶ Make sure all connections are water tight.   \n▶ Fill the descaling reservoir with descaling solution so both lines inside are submersed. We recommend a straight white vinegar solution. If using a commercial descalant, refer to manufacturer's instructions for proper dilution ratio.   \n▶ Ensure both drain connections are open.   \n▶ Operate the circulating pump. Make sure there are no leaks and the solution is flowing from the descaling reservoir through the heater and returning to the reservoir. Run the solution through the heater until the solution returning to the descaling reservoir comes out clear. (Changing to a fresh solution may be necessary during this process). Disconnect all lines and drain all solution\n######################\nOutput:",

Check all wire connections including plugged connectors.   \n2. Verify the fuse in the control board is good. To access the fuse, the control board must be removed. See chapter 5.2, page 45.   \n3. Make sure cold water inlet connection is plumbed to the right side of the heater when facing unit. See fig. 28, page 38.   \n4. A minimum of 0.45 gallons per minute $( 1 . 7 | / \\mathsf { m } )$ of hot water demand is required to activate the heater. Confirm at least 0.4 gpm flow by timing how long it takes to fill a container. A quart container should fill in 20 seconds or less, from the hot water faucet only. Gradually increase water flow (hot water demand) through the heater to determine if the heater activates with higher flow.   \n5. Clean the inlet water filter screen per chapter 4.10, page 37.   \n6. Inspect the water path for obstructions. Make sure all shower heads, faucet aerators and whole house filters are clear of debris.   \n7. Check for a plumbing crossover. A crossover in the hot and cold plumbing pipes creates back pressure on the water flowing through the heater. Therefore, a higher flow rate than normal is needed to force the heater to activate. To check for a plumbing crossover, shut off the cold water supply to the water heater. Then open all of the hot water faucets served by the water heater. Wait 10 minutes and check for water flow at each faucet. There should be no water flowing. Any continuous flow of water, small or large, indicates a crossover is present and must be corrected. Consult a professional plumber for help in correcting a crossover. Failing single lever faucet mixing valves are common causes of plumbing crossovers.   \n8. With the water heater's power supply cord unplugged, remove the unit's front cover (See fig. 3, page 12). Check all wire connections between the water valve, control unit and electrode set fig. 68, page 74).   \n9. Check all wire connections between the water valve/water flow sensor, control unit and electrode set. See chapter 10, page 74. \n\n8.3 Water is too hot \n\n1. Selected temperature on the unit is too high. To lower output temperature, see chapter 6.4, page 46. \n\n2. Confirm the heater's gas type coincides with the type of gas being supplied. See fig. 2, page 12 for location of rating plate. \n\n8.4 Water is not hot enough \n\n1. Selected temperature on the unit is too low. To raise output temperature, see chapter 6.4, page 46.   \n2. Confirm the heater's gas type coincides with the type of gas being supplied. See fig. 2, page 12 for location of rating plate.   \n3. Verify gas pressure is in accordance with specifications in chapter 4.13, page 44. A gas pressure reading is needed to proceed further. Contact your Locally Licensed Professional or a local certified gas technician to obtain this reading.   \n4. Check inlet gas particle screen/filter for blockage at inlet gas valve. Need to remove gas valve from the appliance.   \n5. Cold water is mixing into the hot water lines (plumbing crossover). A plumbing crossover can unintentionally mix cold water with the hot water leaving the heater. The end result is a cooler water temperature than desired. To check for a plumbing crossover, shut off the cold water supply to the water heater. Then open all of the hot water faucets served by the heater. Wait 10 minutes and check all faucets for water flow. There should be\n######################\nOutput:",

Analysts attribute the selloff to investor concerns over rising interest rates and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nAmong the hardest hit, Nexon Technologies saw its stock plummet by 7.8% after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. In contrast, Omega Energy posted a modest 2.1% gain, driven by rising oil prices.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity markets reflected a mixed sentiment.

Cold water is mixing into the hot water lines (plumbing crossover). A plumbing crossover can unintentionally mix cold water with the hot water leaving the heater. The end result is a cooler water temperature than desired. To check for a plumbing crossover, shut off the cold water supply to the water heater. Then open all of the hot water faucets served by the heater. Wait 10 minutes and check all faucets for water flow. There should be no water flowing. Any continuous flow of water, small or large, indicates a crossover and must be corrected. Consult a professional plumber for help in correcting a crossover. Failing single lever faucet mixing valves are common causes of plumbing crossovers. \n\n8.5 Low water flow/pressure \n\n1. Too many hot water applications are being used simultaneously or too much flow is demanded. The water heater will effectively support two 2.0-2.5 GPM shower heads simultaneously or multiple sink applications. Greater draws will result in a water pressure drop and reduced flow at faucets.   \n2. If the selected temperature on the unit is set too high for the demanded flow rate, the water heater will close its motorized water valve, reducing the hot water flow rate in an attempt to reach the selected output temperature. Lowering the selected temperature will allow the motorized water valve to open up for increased water flow rate.   \n3. Clean inlet filter screen as instructed in chapter 7.1, page 58 to increase flow through the heater.   \n4. Inspect the water path for obstructions. Make sure all shower heads, faucet aerators and whole house filters are clear of debris. It may be necessary to upgrade to higher flow rate shower heads if allowed by local code. \n\n5. In areas where the water has a high mineral content, periodic descaling may necessary. See chapter 7.3, page 59 for directions. \n\n8.6 Hot water temperature fluctuates at faucet \n\n1. If the water heater set point temperature is high, mixing at the faucet could deactivate the water heater. The addition of too much cold will overpower hot water flow from the tankless water heater reducing its flow below the activation point. If this slows the flow through the tankless water heater below its activation point, it will shut off the burner.   \n2. Unbalanced pressure in water lines. Any restriction in the water heater, such as a clogged inlet water filter screen, can result in unequal pressures between the cold and hot water lines. In such cases, when mixing in the higher pressure cold water at the faucet, the lower pressure hot water can be overpowered. This will shut down the burners because the hot water flow rate falls below the minimum flow rate required for activation. Verify that the inlet water filter screen is clean and clear of debris. See chapter 7.1, page 58 for inlet water filter cleaning instructions.   \n3. The water heater may be deactivated by temperature balancing shower valves. If the water heater's set point temperature is set too high, the temperature balance shower valve will automatically mix in cold water to reduce the hot water temperature. An adjustment should be made to minimize the amount of cold water the valve is adding. Additionally, the temperature setting on the water heater can be lowered to reduce the amount of cold water that the temperature balance valve mixes in.   \n4. Inlet water pressure is erratic due to fluctuating supply water pressure. For installation on a private well system with the use of a pressure tank, the lowest pressure range setting recommended is 30 - 45 psi (2.06 - 3.1 bar). Consult your Locally Licensed Professional or local plumber for effective ways to maintain constant water pressure to the appliance when on a well system. \n\n8.7 Noisy burner/heater during operation \n\nBurner noises can be heard if combustion is not properly set. This could be caused by improper gas supply conditions (gas pressure and/or gas composition). Two types of noise can be heard: low pitch noise/vibration (rumbling) and high pitch noise/vibration (whistling). \n\n8.7.1 High pitch noise \n\n1. Verify if correct gas type is selected (see section 6.8). 2. Verify is gas pressure is within specified range (see section 3.2). \n\n3. Ensure that the venting used is according to specifications (see section 4.6) and cross contamination does not exist. Ensure that intake and exhaust terminations maintain required clearances. If gas type is properly selected, gas pressure is within range, the venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \n4. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \n\n8.7.2 Low pitch noise \n\n1. Verify if correct gas type is selected (see section 6.8).   \n2. Verify if gas pressure is within specified range (see section 3.2). If gas type is properly selected, gas pressure is within range, the venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \n3. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \n\n8.8 Error codes C1, C2, CF and/or CE \n\nC1, C2, CF and CE errors could be caused by a too long flue and/or an obstruction in the venting. \n\n1. Verify if there are any venting obstructions and remove them if that is the case.   \n2. Ensure that the venting used is according to specifications (see section 4.6).   \n3. Reset the error by holding the On/Off button for 3s. If there are no obstructions and venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \n4. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \n\n8.9\n######################\nOutput:",

Air filter must be cleaned or replaced in case it is clogged or damaged. \\n\\nHow to remove/assembly air filter \\n\\n▶ Disconnect the electrical supply from the water heater.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Remove appliance front cover, see page 12.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Remove cover from the air filter.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Loosen two philips head screws.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Remove air filter from the fan.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Clean filter with soft toothbrush, do not use water or compressed air.   \\n▶ Proceed in the reverse order for assembly. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nAppliance malfunction! \\n\\nAir filter should not be removed during appliance normal operation as, as it may increase the risk of burner blockage. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nRisk of burner blockage! \\n\\n▶ Paper filter (part # 8738725270) installed on the air fan for increased protection against dusty, dirty combustion air or heavy pollen entering the combustion chamber to reduce the risk of burner blockage. Maintenance frequency might need to be adjusted to keep the filter clean and allow a good performance of the heater. \\n\\n7.2 Winterizing for seasonal use \\n\\nThe water heater must not be installed in a location where it may be exposed to freezing temperatures unless connected to electrical power. All water must be drained from the heater in order to avoid damage to the unit from exposure to freezing temperatures. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nUse of agents such as anti-freeze is not permitted and voids the warranty, as they may cause damage to the water heater's internal components. \\n\\n1. Hold ON/OFF switch on the water heater for 3 secs. to turn OFF the heater and unplug the power supply cord. The display should be blank.   \\n2. Shut off the gas supply to the water heater.   \\n3. Shut off the water supply to the water heater using installer supplied shutoff valve.   \\n4. Open hot water faucets to drain and relieve pressure from the plumbing system. If water continues to flow after 5 minutes, a crossover of the hot and cold water pipes is present and must be corrected before proceeding.   \\n5. Disconnect the inlet and outlet water pipes from the water heater. Place a small bucket underneath the water heater to catch residual water remaining inside the water heater.   \\n6. Using an air compressor, blow short bursts of air (50psi max) through the inlet water connection or inlet water filter until there is no water present coming through the outlet water connection of the heater.   \\n7. Empty condensate trap.   \\n8. Reconnect the water fittings and return the heater to service when danger of freezing has passed. \\n\\n7.3 Mineral scale build-up \\n\\nPeriodic descaling may be necessary in areas with high mineral content in the water (See table 17 Water Quality). Scale buildup in the heat exchanger may result in lower flow rates, error codes of AA, E3, A5 and boiling sounds in the heat exchanger. \\n\\nA water softener is required if the water hardness exceeds 12 grains/gal $( 2 0 0 \\\\mathsf { m g } / | )$ calcium carbonate. Damage to the water heater resulting from hard water/scale deposits will not be covered under warranty. \\n\\nDescaling using a pump \\n\\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Disconnect the electrical supply from the water heater.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Shut off the water supply to the water heater.   \\n$\\\\blacktriangleright$ Open hot water faucets to drain and relieve pressure from the plumbing system. Shut off hot water valve to the water heater. Remove the caps from both inlet and outlet drain connections. Connect a line (A) from the outlet of the circulating pump (installer supplied) to the inlet drain connection on the water heater (see fig. 55.)   \\n▶ Using another line (B), connect the outlet drain connection on the water heater. Route the other end of this line into a descaling reservoir.   \\n▶ Using a 3rd line (C) from the descaling reservoir, connect to the inlet side of circulating pump. Install a filter on the end of the line in the descaling reservoir.   \\n▶ Make sure all connections are water tight.   \\n▶ Fill the descaling reservoir with descaling solution so both lines inside are submersed. We recommend a straight white vinegar solution. If using a commercial descalant, refer to manufacturer's instructions for proper dilution ratio.   \\n▶ Ensure both drain connections are open.   \\n▶ Operate the circulating pump. Make sure there are no leaks and the solution is flowing from the descaling reservoir through the heater and returning to the reservoir. Run the solution through the heater until the solution returning to the descaling reservoir comes out clear. (Changing to a fresh solution may be necessary during this process). Disconnect all lines and drain all solution\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Inlet Water Filter\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The inlet water filter is a component located on the top of the appliance at the cold water inlet connection.

It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.\n\nThen Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. \"If this tech can be understood...\" Taylor said, their voice quieter, \"It could change the game for us.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nNeed to remove gas valve from the appliance.   \\n5. Cold water is mixing into the hot water lines (plumbing crossover). A plumbing crossover can unintentionally mix cold water with the hot water leaving the heater. The end result is a cooler water temperature than desired. To check for a plumbing crossover, shut off the cold water supply to the water heater. Then open all of the hot water faucets served by the heater. Wait 10 minutes and check all faucets for water flow. There should be no water flowing. Any continuous flow of water, small or large, indicates a crossover and must be corrected. Consult a professional plumber for help in correcting a crossover. Failing single lever faucet mixing valves are common causes of plumbing crossovers. \\n\\n8.5 Low water flow/pressure \\n\\n1. Too many hot water applications are being used simultaneously or too much flow is demanded. The water heater will effectively support two 2.0-2.5 GPM shower heads simultaneously or multiple sink applications. Greater draws will result in a water pressure drop and reduced flow at faucets.   \\n2. If the selected temperature on the unit is set too high for the demanded flow rate, the water heater will close its motorized water valve, reducing the hot water flow rate in an attempt to reach the selected output temperature. Lowering the selected temperature will allow the motorized water valve to open up for increased water flow rate.   \\n3. Clean inlet filter screen as instructed in chapter 7.1, page 58 to increase flow through the heater.   \\n4. Inspect the water path for obstructions. Make sure all shower heads, faucet aerators and whole house filters are clear of debris. It may be necessary to upgrade to higher flow rate shower heads if allowed by local code. \\n\\n5. In areas where the water has a high mineral content, periodic descaling may necessary. See chapter 7.3, page 59 for directions. \\n\\n8.6 Hot water temperature fluctuates at faucet \\n\\n1. If the water heater set point temperature is high, mixing at the faucet could deactivate the water heater. The addition of too much cold will overpower hot water flow from the tankless water heater reducing its flow below the activation point. If this slows the flow through the tankless water heater below its activation point, it will shut off the burner.   \\n2. Unbalanced pressure in water lines. Any restriction in the water heater, such as a clogged inlet water filter screen, can result in unequal pressures between the cold and hot water lines. In such cases, when mixing in the higher pressure cold water at the faucet, the lower pressure hot water can be overpowered. This will shut down the burners because the hot water flow rate falls below the minimum flow rate required for activation. Verify that the inlet water filter screen is clean and clear of debris. See chapter 7.1, page 58 for inlet water filter cleaning instructions.   \\n3. The water heater may be deactivated by temperature balancing shower valves. If the water heater's set point temperature is set too high, the temperature balance shower valve will automatically mix in cold water to reduce the hot water temperature. An adjustment should be made to minimize the amount of cold water the valve is adding. Additionally, the temperature setting on the water heater can be lowered to reduce the amount of cold water that the temperature balance valve mixes in.   \\n4. Inlet water pressure is erratic due to fluctuating supply water pressure. For installation on a private well system with the use of a pressure tank, the lowest pressure range setting recommended is 30 - 45 psi (2.06 - 3.1 bar). Consult your Locally Licensed Professional or local plumber for effective ways to maintain constant water pressure to the appliance when on a well system. \\n\\n8.7 Noisy burner/heater during operation \\n\\nBurner noises can be heard if combustion is not properly set. This could be caused by improper gas supply conditions (gas pressure and/or gas composition). Two types of noise can be heard: low pitch noise/vibration (rumbling) and high pitch noise/vibration (whistling). \\n\\n8.7.1 High pitch noise \\n\\n1. Verify if correct gas type is selected (see section 6.8). 2. Verify is gas pressure is within specified range (see section 3.2). \\n\\n3. Ensure that the venting used is according to specifications (see section 4.6) and cross contamination does not exist. Ensure that intake and exhaust terminations maintain required clearances. If gas type is properly selected, gas pressure is within range, the venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \\n4. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \\n\\n8.7.2 Low pitch noise \\n\\n1. Verify if correct gas type is selected (see section 6.8).   \\n2. Verify if gas pressure is within specified range (see section 3.2). If gas type is properly selected, gas pressure is within range, the venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \\n3. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \\n\\n8.8 Error codes C1, C2, CF and/or CE \\n\\nC1, C2, CF and CE errors could be caused by a too long flue and/or an obstruction in the venting. \\n\\n1. Verify if there are any venting obstructions and remove them if that is the case.   \\n2. Ensure that the venting used is according to specifications (see section 4.6).   \\n3. Reset the error by holding the On/Off button for 3s. If there are no obstructions and venting is according to specifications, and the problem persists:   \\n4. Perform the gas and air adjustment as described in section 8.12. \\n\\n8.9\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Gas

If using a commercial descalant, refer to manufacturer's instructions for proper dilution ratio.   \\n▶ Ensure both drain connections are open.   \\n▶ Operate the circulating pump. Make sure there are no leaks and the solution is flowing from the descaling reservoir through the heater and returning to the reservoir. Run the solution through the heater until the solution returning to the descaling reservoir comes out clear. (Changing to a fresh solution may be necessary during this process). Disconnect all lines and drain all solution from heat exchanger. Properly discard the solution.   \\n▶ Attach the cap to the inlet drain connection to close it. Position a container below the outlet drain connection and connect the cold water supply. Open the cold water supply shutoff valve and flush the heat exchanger with clean water.   \\n▶ Close the cold water shutoff valve and reconnect hot water supply to the water heater.   \\n▶ Attach the cap to the outlet drain connection to close it. \\n\\n▶ Reconnect the electrical supply to the unit, open the water shutoff valves, and return the unit to service. \\n\\n[1] Pump [2] Water filter \\n\\n8 Troubleshooting \\n\\nWARNING: \\n\\n▶ If you are unable to perform the tasks listed below, or need additional assistance please contact a Locally Licensed Professional. \\n\\nNOTICE: \\n\\nIn some areas local code may require that the tasks described in this section must be performed by a Locally Licensed Professional. \\n\\nPlease check your local codes to ensure compliance. \\n\\n8.1 Introduction \\n\\nMany of the questions customers ask regarding operation of this unit can be answered by following the troubleshooting steps as outlined below. For best results, perform each step before proceeding to the next. The suggested solutions may require that the cover be taken off (see fig. 3, page 12). \\n\\n8.2 Burner does not ignite when a hot water faucet is opened \\n\\nIt is recommended to use “P4 Information” page 48, chapter 6.5.1 as a tool for problem solving. \\n\\n1. If the display is blank, verify power at the outlet. (120VAC/   \\n60Hz properly grounded circuit required). Confirm power to the heater. Check all wire connections including plugged connectors.   \\n2. Verify the fuse in the control board is good. To access the fuse, the control board must be removed. See chapter 5.2, page 45.   \\n3. Make sure cold water inlet connection is plumbed to the right side of the heater when facing unit. See fig. 28, page 38.   \\n4. A minimum of 0.45 gallons per minute $( 1 . 7 | / \\\\mathsf { m } )$ of hot water demand is required to activate the heater. Confirm at least 0.4 gpm flow by timing how long it takes to fill a container. A quart container should fill in 20 seconds or less, from the hot water faucet only. Gradually increase water flow (hot water demand) through the heater to determine if the heater activates with higher flow.   \\n5. Clean the inlet water filter screen per chapter 4.10, page 37.   \\n6. Inspect the water path for obstructions. Make sure all shower heads, faucet aerators and whole house filters are clear of debris.   \\n7. Check for a plumbing crossover. A crossover in the hot and cold plumbing pipes creates back pressure on the water flowing through the heater. Therefore, a higher flow rate than normal is needed to force the heater to activate. To check for a plumbing crossover, shut off the cold water supply to the water heater. Then open all of the hot water faucets served by the water heater. Wait 10 minutes and check for water flow at each faucet. There should be no water flowing. Any continuous flow of water, small or large, indicates a crossover is present and must be corrected. Consult a professional plumber for help in correcting a crossover. Failing single lever faucet mixing valves are common causes of plumbing crossovers.   \\n8. With the water heater's power supply cord unplugged, remove the unit's front cover (See fig. 3, page 12). Check all wire connections between the water valve, control unit and electrode set fig. 68, page 74).   \\n9. Check all wire connections between the water valve/water flow sensor, control unit and electrode set. See chapter 10, page 74. \\n\\n8.3 Water is too hot \\n\\n1. Selected temperature on the unit is too high. To lower output temperature, see chapter 6.4, page 46. \\n\\n2. Confirm the heater's gas type coincides with the type of gas being supplied. See fig. 2, page 12 for location of rating plate. \\n\\n8.4 Water is not hot enough \\n\\n1. Selected temperature on the unit is too low. To raise output temperature, see chapter 6.4, page 46.   \\n2. Confirm the heater's gas type coincides with the type of gas being supplied. See fig. 2, page 12 for location of rating plate.   \\n3. Verify gas pressure is in accordance with specifications in chapter 4.13, page 44. A gas pressure reading is needed to proceed further. Contact your Locally Licensed Professional or a local certified gas technician to obtain this reading.   \\n4. Check inlet gas particle screen/filter for blockage at inlet gas valve. Need to remove gas valve from the appliance.   \\n5. Cold water is mixing into the hot water lines (plumbing crossover). A plumbing crossover can unintentionally mix cold water with the hot water leaving the heater. The end result is a cooler water temperature than desired. To check for a plumbing crossover, shut off the cold water supply to the water heater. Then open all of the hot water faucets served by the heater. Wait 10 minutes and check all faucets for water flow.
